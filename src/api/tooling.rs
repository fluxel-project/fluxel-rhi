//! The capture and diagnostic tooling SPI (specification module 07).
//!
//! This module owns exactly one thing: **the seam a capture tool reaches the RHI
//! through** — the SPI version it negotiates against, the device-scoped access
//! object, the observer contract and the ordering rule its callbacks obey, and
//! the identity of the events it is handed. What those events *contain* is the
//! business of the sibling files ([`definition`](crate::api::tooling::definition),
//! [`mutation`](crate::api::tooling::mutation),
//! [`work`](crate::api::tooling::work), [`plan`](crate::api::tooling::plan),
//! [`event`](crate::api::tooling::event)); this file only states how a tool gets
//! to them.
//!
//! Those paths are written fully-qualified rather than shortened. That is no
//! longer *required* — the outer doc comment `api/mod.rs` used to place on
//! `pub mod tooling` is gone, and with it the merge that made rustdoc resolve
//! this block's links against `api` instead of against `tooling`. They are kept
//! because a fully-qualified path cannot be broken by where the module is
//! declared, and this is not a trap worth re-arming for the sake of four deleted
//! path segments.
//!
//! It does not own a capture *format*, a capture *policy*, or a replayer. See
//! "What is deliberately absent" below — that list is load-bearing, and the
//! reason this chapter is short is that most of what a reader expects from a
//! "tooling" module belongs to a layer that is not the RHI.
//!
//! # Why this is `#[doc(hidden)]`
//!
//! Declared `#[doc(hidden)]` by `api/mod.rs` because it is an audience
//! statement, not a stability one. Everything here is public, versioned, and
//! semver-governed; it is simply not what a *rendering* caller learns. A caller
//! that never opens a capture tool never names a type in this module.

//!
//! # The two invariants
//!
//! 1. **Nothing in a captured record is a live handle.** Every captured type
//!    names an object by [`crate::api::identity::ObjectId`], by
//!    [`crate::api::presentation::AcquiredFrameId`], or by its own capture-local
//!    definition. Section 54 states this as the list of what a tooling definition
//!    may contain — value types, `ObjectId`, `AcquiredFrameId` — and section 58.8
//!    states the security half of it: no native pointer, OS handle, GPU virtual
//!    address, descriptor heap index, absolute host-memory address, or credential.
//!    The two rules together are why a captured record can outlive the device
//!    that produced it.
//! 2. **[`SemanticEventId`](crate::api::tooling::SemanticEventId) is CPU
//!    observation order, not GPU execution order**
//!    (§53.3). Two events in increasing id order say nothing about which GPU work
//!    ran first. Real GPU order is stated only by the order within a
//!    `PortableCommand` list, by `SubmissionPlan` lane order, by explicit
//!    dependencies, and by the present relation — see
//!    [`work`](crate::api::tooling::work) and
//!    [`plan`](crate::api::tooling::plan). A
//!    reader that treats the event stream as a trace has misread the chapter.
//!
//! # Section 52's prerequisites, audited
//!
//! Section 52 is not a list of types for this module to add. It is the list of
//! capabilities RHI must *already* have for portable capture/replay to be
//! possible later, and every one of them belongs to the chapter that owns the
//! thing being made observable. Auditing them here is the point of the section:
//! a gap is discovered as a missing accessor rather than as a Replay bug two
//! years later. Each item below was traced to its owner.
//!
//! ```text
//! §52.1  Buffer / Texture / TextureView / Sampler
//!        api::resource::{buffer, texture, view, sampler}
//!        -- each handle answers id(), device_identity(), descriptor()
//!
//! §52.1  ShaderModule
//!        api::shader::ShaderModule -- id(), device_identity(), artifact();
//!        the reconstructable definition is the artifact itself, which is why
//!        artifact() is a real accessor rather than a creation-time-only input
//!
//! §52.1  BindGroupLayout / BindGroup
//!        api::binding::layout::BindGroupLayout -- descriptor() returns the
//!        *canonicalized* descriptor, so capture records what the layout is
//!        rather than what the caller typed
//!        api::binding::group::BindGroup -- layout(), descriptor()
//!
//! §52.1  PipelineInterface / RasterPipeline / ComputePipeline
//!        api::pipeline::{interface, raster, compute} -- descriptor() on each,
//!        plus interface() on the two pipelines
//!
//! §52.1  UploadJob
//!        api::resource::transfer::upload::UploadJob -- id(),
//!        device_identity(), descriptor()
//!
//! §52.1  ReadbackTicket
//!        api::resource::transfer::readback::ReadbackTicket -- id(),
//!        device_identity(), request()
//!
//! §52.1  RecordedWork
//!        api::command::RecordedWork -- id(), device_identity(),
//!        work_domains(), resource_uses(), and a crate-private commands()
//!        that the describe_work path reads
//!
//! §52.1  Submission / Completion, AcquiredFrame / Present
//!        Named by their own device-scoped tokens -- SubmissionPlanId,
//!        SubmissionPoint, CompletionPoint, PresentPlanId, PresentReceiptId,
//!        AcquiredFrameId -- and NOT by ObjectId. Section 52.1's list says
//!        "ObjectId" for every entry; sections 57 and 58.1 use these tokens for
//!        exactly these rows. Resolution: the specific sections win, because a
//!        plan point and a present receipt are evidence of an event rather than
//!        an object in the inventory, and ObjectId is defined as the identity of
//!        an object the device created. Recorded in the 0.16 audit.
//!
//! §52.2  Live RecordedWork rebuildable
//!        api::command retains the ordered commands with their per-command use
//!        lists, the merged use summary, the work domains, and the debug push /
//!        pop / marker payloads with their labels. The commands are rebuilt by
//!        *normalization* rather than echoed -- a draw records the state that was
//!        current when it was issued, not a preceding run of state-setting
//!        commands -- which work::PortableCommand documents in full.
//!
//! §52.3  Object reconstruction graph
//!        definition::CapturedObjectDefinition, fed by the accessors listed under
//!        §52.1 above: a TextureView names its texture, a BindGroup names its
//!        layout and its resources, a PipelineInterface names its layouts, and a
//!        RasterPipeline names its modules, its interface, and its fixed state.
//!
//! §52.4  Upload mutation
//!        api::resource::transfer::upload::UploadDescriptor retains the
//!        destination, the offset/subresource, the HostTexelLayout, and the
//!        source bytes as an Arc<[u8]>, so capture never re-reads the CPU data it
//!        just uploaded.
//!
//! §52.5  Readback primitive
//!        api::resource::transfer::readback -- ReadbackRequest carries the
//!        buffer range or the textured region, ReadbackTexelLayout carries the
//!        row/image layout, and ReadbackStatus plus ReadbackTicket::try_read
//!        carry completion-aware readiness. RHI does not decide when to snapshot.
//!
//! §52.6  Submission / present visibility
//!        api::submission::{SubmissionPlanBuilder, SubmissionPlan,
//!        SubmissionReceipt, PlanPoint, SubmissionLaneId, SubmissionBatchId,
//!        SubmissionPoint, CompletionPoint} and
//!        api::presentation::{PresentPlanId, PresentReceiptId, PresentState}.
//!        The builder is what makes a plan observable at all; it was still
//!        unwritten when this audit was first taken and landed in module 05
//!        during the same series, so the item is closed.
//!        plan::CapturedSubmissionPlan carries the relation rather than the
//!        counts.
//!
//! §52.7  Shader provenance
//!        api::shader::ShaderArtifact carries code, abi_version, interface,
//!        requirements, and provenance; definition::CapturedObjectDefinition::
//!        Shader carries the whole artifact rather than a lowered form, so the
//!        ReplayRuntime can judge direct acceptance / recompile / unsupported
//!        without RHI having a cross-backend compiler.
//!
//! §52.8  Device loss / terminal events
//!        api::platform::{DeviceStatus, DeviceLossInfo} plus the terminal states
//!        CompletionState::DeviceLost, ReadbackStatus::DeviceLost,
//!        AcquiredFrameState::DeviceLost, PresentState::DeviceLost, and
//!        event::SemanticEvent::DeviceLost. The tooling subscription's own half
//!        of the rule is enforced here: subscribe() refuses on an already-lost
//!        device, because section 52.8 forbids handing a capture tool a
//!        subscription that can never reach a terminal observation.
//! ```
//!
//! ## Known gaps found by that audit
//!
//! One item is open, and it is a manifest decision rather than a source one.
//!
//! * **The tooling SPI is not behind its feature.** Section 53 recommends an
//!   independent `rhi-tooling` feature so that an ordinary release build does not
//!   carry the observer surface, and `Cargo.toml` declares none, so
//!   there is nothing for this module to be gated on. A manifest change is the
//!   caller's, not this module's. The detail is in the Cargo section below.
//!
//! # What is deliberately absent
//!
//! Sections 58.3 through 58.6 and 58.8 are absences, and the honest output for
//! an absence is a statement rather than a type. There is no `ArtifactLayer`,
//! no `ReplayRuntime`, no `SnapshotPolicy`, and no capture-file writer in this
//! crate, and adding one "for completeness" would put a debug product inside the
//! execution API:
//!
//! * **The Artifact Layer (§58.3, §58.7).** RHI does not own the magic, the
//!   schema major/minor, chunks, a manifest, compression, dedup, blob hashing,
//!   signatures, encryption, or artifact migration.
//!   [`TOOLING_SPI_VERSION`](crate::api::tooling::TOOLING_SPI_VERSION) is
//!   the tooling SPI's version and is *not* an artifact schema version; the two
//!   version independently, and conflating them is the specific mistake section
//!   58.3 names. Section 56 adds the encoding half: a Rust enum discriminant or
//!   memory layout must never be written directly as an artifact opcode, so the
//!   artifact layer must supply its own tagged, versioned, bounds-checked,
//!   canonical encoding.
//! * **Capture dependency closure (§58.4).** RHI does not answer "which
//!   producers must be added before passes 30 to 40", "must this persistent
//!   texture written in an earlier frame be snapshotted", or "how many frames of
//!   a history resource are needed". That is RenderGraph's and the Capture
//!   Coordinator's question.
//! * **Snapshot policy (§58.5).** RHI provides readback, resource descriptors,
//!   and actual use. The capture side decides the snapshot point, the
//!   subresource, full bytes versus hash-only, the size budget, redaction, and
//!   external fixtures.
//! * **`ReplayRuntime` (§58.6).** Reading and safely parsing an artifact, schema
//!   migration, target selection, capability negotiation, shader rebuild,
//!   object-graph rebuild, command rebuild, submission rebuild, external
//!   fixtures, observation/diff, and the step debugger all belong to it. It
//!   ultimately calls only the normal RHI API, which is why nothing in this
//!   module is a replay entry point. Section 58.7 fixes the source of truth it
//!   reads: the
//!   [`definition::CapturedObjectDefinition`](crate::api::tooling::definition::CapturedObjectDefinition)
//!   graph, initial snapshots and upload mutations,
//!   [`work::PortableCommand`](crate::api::tooling::work::PortableCommand), and
//!   [`plan::CapturedSubmissionPlan`](crate::api::tooling::plan::CapturedSubmissionPlan).
//!   `FrozenGraphIR` belongs to RenderGraph and
//!   is provenance and validation material, not the replay input.
//! * **The security boundary (§58.8).** Redaction, omission, and encryption of
//!   shader source, labels, and upload bytes are capture policy. RHI keeps the
//!   *semantics* free of native identifiers; it does not decide what a tool is
//!   allowed to write down. Note the one type that carries content rather than
//!   structure:
//!   [`mutation::CapturedUploadDefinition`](crate::api::tooling::mutation::CapturedUploadDefinition)
//!   carries the uploaded
//!   bytes, and section 55.3 states plainly that the artifact layer, not RHI,
//!   decides whether they are redacted or encrypted.
//!
//! # Section 53's Cargo feature is not declared here
//!
//! Section 53 recommends an independent `rhi-tooling` feature so that an ordinary
//! release build does not carry the observer surface. `api/mod.rs` declares
//! `pub mod tooling` unconditionally today, and the feature is a manifest
//! decision rather than a source decision, so it is recorded as a gap instead of
//! being spelled here as a `#[cfg(feature = ...)]` that no manifest backs. What
//! section 53 does fix regardless of the feature is that the *reconstructable
//! semantic contract of `RecordedWork`* exists in every build.

/// Drop begins            -> unregistration; every callback that began before

/// is guaranteed not to race with a callback it already got. The reverse is a
/// contract the type cannot enforce: an observer must not drop its own

/// currently executing — it would be the observer waiting on itself, and if it
/// could be detected it would be a deadlock rather than an error.
