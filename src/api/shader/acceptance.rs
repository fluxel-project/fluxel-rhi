//! Section 19.8's acceptance decision: may this device use this artifact?
//!
//! One rule, in one place, over device facts and nothing else. It answers the
//! question [`EnabledCapabilities::shader_acceptance`](crate::api::capability::EnabledCapabilities::shader_acceptance)
//! is declared to answer, and it is what `Device::create_shader` consults before a
//! backend ever sees the artifact (section 19.10).
//!
//! # What it is not
//!
//! Not the portable half of the check. `validate_shader_artifact` owns the
//! canonicality rules, and section 19.6 makes those a *producer's* mistake, which
//! is why they are an [`RhiError`](crate::api::error::RhiError) and this is a
//! verdict. The two overlap in exactly one place, deliberately: the binding
//! support of each interface resource appears on section 19.10's list *and* in
//! this rule, because a caller may ask this question on its own — the answer is a
//! device fact, and a caller deciding whether to build an artifact does not want a
//! `Result` about the artifact's spelling along with it.
//!
//! Nor is it a compile. Section 19.10 says a runtime GLSL/MSL compile error is
//! returned through `RhiError` plus a `DiagnosticEvent`; this rule decides whether
//! the device will *try*, and it cannot decide more than that, because for a source
//! form there is no compiler here to ask.
//!
//! # Why the backend kind is not consulted
//!
//! Section 19.2 names a canonical form per backend, which invites the shortest
//! possible implementation: remember the [`BackendKind`] and match the code form
//! against it. That is refused, and section 6.3 is why — the kind a device reports
//! is "diagnostics, selection provenance, and tooling UI only", explicitly **not**
//! a capability oracle. Two devices of one kind can differ about which forms they
//! consume (a desktop GL context and a GLES context are the same backend kind and
//! different answers), so the accepted forms are recorded facts, exactly like every
//! other capability, and this rule reads the record.
//!
