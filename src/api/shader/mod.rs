//! Shader code, entry-point interface, requirements, and the artifact a device
//! accepts (specification section 19).
//!
//! Section 19 opens by refusing to conflate three layers that a "portable shader
//! blob" would merge, and this module is organised along those three:
//!
//! ```text
//! ShaderCode        a code form the current backend can consume
//! ShaderInterface   the portable semantics of one entry point
//! ```
//!
//! Shader code is not restricted to one source language. A device first gets
//! the code form it natively accepts; when it does not, the default `naga`
//! Cargo feature may translate supported source/target pairs. Without that
//! feature, or when Naga does not support the requested pair, creation returns
//! `Unsupported`. SPIR-V may be toolchain-portable without any browser being
//! able to execute it, so acceptance remains a device capability question.
//!
//! # What this module owns
//!
//! - The stage vocabulary and its mask ([`ShaderStage`], [`ShaderStages`]).
//! - The code forms ([`ShaderCode`], [`GlslProfile`]) and the lowering ABI
//!   version an artifact declares ([`ShaderAbiVersion`]).
//! - The 32-bit stage IO vocabulary ([`ShaderNumericType`], [`ShaderLocation`],
//!   [`ShaderInterpolation`], [`ShaderLocationInterface`]).
//! - The entry-point description ([`ShaderInterface`]) and what it needs from the
//!   device ([`ShaderRequirements`]).
//! - Artifact identity ([`ArtifactHash`], [`ArtifactProducerVersion`]).
//! - The artifact itself ([`ShaderArtifact`]) and the created module
//!   ([`ShaderModule`]).
//!
//! # What this module deliberately does not own
//!
//! - *Binding* vocabulary. Section 19.5 makes an entry point's resource
//!   requirements reuse [`crate::api::binding`]'s kinds and counts directly, so
//!   that reflection and layout cannot drift into two systems. There is no
//!   `ShaderBindingKind` here, and adding one would be the failure the section
//!   names.
//! - *Binding capability*. Section 19.7 forbids repeating it in
//!   [`ShaderRequirements`]: it is answered by asking
//!   [`BindingSupportQuery`](crate::api::binding::BindingSupportQuery) about each
//!   [`ShaderInterface`] resource.
//! - Logical group/slot to native register/index lowering, location to native
//!   semantic mapping, and the argument-buffer/root-signature strategy. All three
//!   stay backend/toolchain-private (section 19.3).
//! - Pipeline specialization-constant resolution. A P0 artifact must have
//!   pipeline specialization *closed* (section 19.9); supplying values at
//!   pipeline creation belongs to a future capability family.
//!
//! # The rules this module decides
//!
//! `validate_shader_artifact` is the portable half of `create_shader`'s
//! validation list (section 19.10). It runs before any backend is touched, and it
//! refuses rather than normalizes: section 19.6 makes a duplicate or
//! non-canonical interface a rejection, explicitly *not* something the RHI may
//! silently sort, merge, or choose from.
//!
//! The remaining entries of that list are device facts — `ArtifactAcceptance`,
//! `ShaderAbiVersion` acceptance, and binding support — so they are answered by
//! the device façade. The first two are `acceptance.rs`'s decision rule, reached
//! through `EnabledCapabilities::shader_acceptance`; the third is the device's own
//! answer, which `validation.rs` receives as a parameter so that it stays
//! decidable without a backend.
//!
//! # Files
//!
//! One part of the chapter per file, with this file holding only the declarations
//! and the re-exports of the *public* types:
//!
//! ```text
//! mod.rs          declarations and re-exports, no rule of its own
//! vocabulary.rs   sections 19.1-19.4, stages, code forms, and locations
//! requirements.rs section 19.5-19.7, what an entry point requires
//! artifact.rs     sections 19.8-19.9, artifact identity and the created module
//! validation.rs   sections 19.6-19.10, the portable validators
//! acceptance.rs   section 19.8, the device's verdict on one artifact
//! lowering.rs     optional common source-to-SPIR-V lowering
//! ```
//!
//! The re-export list is the module's public contract with the rest of the crate:
//! `crate::api::shader::X` names every public type this chapter defines.
//!
//! `validate_shader_artifact` and `stage_mask` are crate-private and are not
//! re-exported. Each submodule stays crate-visible rather than private because the
//! validators it owns are crate-private entry points of their own. Keeping their
//! paths at the defining file makes ownership explicit, so a crate-internal
//! caller names the file that defines the item.
