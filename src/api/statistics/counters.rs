//! The cumulative and per-interval counter records (specification 47.5–47.8 and
//! 47.10–47.12).
//!
//! Every type here is a plain record of `u64` counters with public fields, and
//! that is deliberate rather than lazy: the metric *definitions* are frozen
//! across backends, so a caller must be able to read a named field, and a
//! backend must be unable to invent a counter of its own. An opaque map would
//! let two backends both report "draw calls" while meaning different things.
//!
//! Three rules apply to every counter in this file, and they come from section
//! 47 rather than from this module:
//!
//! - **Saturating, never wrapping.** Section 47.5 forbids wraparound: a counter
//!   that reached `u64::MAX` stays there. Silent wraparound would turn a
//!   long-running system's numbers into plausible-looking garbage.
//! - **Semantic, not native.** A command count is a count of Fluxel commands,
//!   and section 47.6 is explicit that it is not a `VkCmd` count, a D3D12
//!   command count, a Metal encoder-call count, or a WebGPU internal command
//!   count. The numbers are comparable across backends precisely because none of
//!   them is a driver's number.
//! - **Effective, not called.** A *change* counter counts a change in effective
//!   state, not an API call — except where the name says `_calls`, which counts
//!   calls. Section 47.21 freezes both definitions, and the distinction is why
//!   binding a pipeline twice in a row increments `pipeline_bind_calls` by two
//!   and `pipeline_changes` by one.
//!
//! Section 47.7 adds the scope rule that makes the change counters well-defined:
//! command state such as pipeline and bind group is considered unbound at the
//! start of every raster or compute scope, so setting the same pipeline in two
//! scopes is two changes.
