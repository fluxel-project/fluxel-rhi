//! Copy, resolve, and blit descriptors and their portable validation
//! (specification sections 34.1 through 34.5), plus the upload and readback
//! encoding rules (section 35).
//!
//! This module owns the six copy-family descriptors, the blit filter, and every
//! check section 34 states that is decidable **without a device**. The verbs
//! themselves are on [`crate::api::command::CommandRecorder`], because section
//! 34.6 records them and only a recorder knows whether it is open.
//!
//! # What is checked here, and what is not
//!
//! Each descriptor has two halves of its rule list:
//!
//! ```text
//! portable   usage bits, identity, ranges, extents, subresource agreement,
//!            same-texture overlap, region-vs-buffer footprint
//! device     RouteQuery::... Support, BufferCopyLayoutLimits /
//!            TexelCopyLayoutLimits alignment, "does this route exist at all"
//! ```
//!
//! The device half is not checked here, and cannot be: a route answer and a
//! native alignment come from a device that has not been created. Section 9.4
//! forbids the backend from quietly substituting a shader or CPU fallback for an
//! unsupported route, so the refusal has to come back as
//! [`crate::api::error::RhiErrorKind::Unsupported`] from the verb — which is why
//! the copy verbs are in the unbuilt tier and the checks below are not.
//!
//! # What this module does not own
//!
//! - Job-level upload and readback validation, which is
//!   [`crate::api::resource::transfer`]'s, performed when a device creates the
//!   job. What section 35 adds is the *actual use* a recorded job produces, and
//!   that mapping lives in [`crate::api::command`].
//! - Host texel layout. Section 34.2 is emphatic that a copy buffer's layout is
//!   GPU copy-buffer layout and not [`crate::api::resource::subresource::HostTexelLayout`];
//!   the upload path may repack one into the other without telling the caller.
//!
//! # The invariant this module enforces
//!
//! **A copy names a real region on both sides, and never aliases itself.** A
//! copy whose source and destination overlap in the same texture is refused
//! rather than lowered, because P0 defines no memmove (section 34.1): a native
//! copy command given overlapping regions has undefined results, and section 4
//! forbids letting a driver discover that.
