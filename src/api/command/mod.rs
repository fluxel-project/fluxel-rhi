//! Recording and actual resource uses (specification sections 29 through 38).
//!
//! This is the chapter that turns a caller's intent into a portable recording: a
//! [`CommandRecorder`] is a CPU-side command builder that accepts copy, raster,
//! compute, upload, and readback commands in sequence and produces a
//! [`RecordedWork`] carrying the commands it recorded, the domains they belong to,
//! and the resources they actually touched.
//!
//! ```text
//! Device::create_recorder        -> CommandRecorder          (29.1)
//! begin_raster / begin_compute   -> an open scope            (29.2, 32, 33)
//! copy / upload / readback       -> recorded, recorder still open   (34.6, 35)
//! finish                         -> RecordedWork             (38.1)
//! ```
//!
//! # What this chapter deliberately is not
//!
//! Section 29 states four of these outright, and they are the reason the type
//! exists at all rather than being a thin wrapper over a native encoder:
//!
//! ```text
//! not a native command list / encoder
//! does not accept an upper-layer scheduling contract
//! does not expose barriers / transitions
//! does not bind a submission lane
//! ```
//!
//! A recorder records *what happened*, never what a caller promised would happen.
//! Barrier and lane decisions belong to the submission plan (section 40).
//!
//! # Submodules
//!
//! The chapter is split by what each file can independently vary:
//!
//! ```text
//! geometry    clear values, rects, viewports, load/store ops      (30)
//! attachment  raster attachment sets and their invariants         (31)
//! raster      RasterScope and the draw verbs                      (32)
//! compute     ComputeScope and dispatch                           (33)
//! copy        copy/resolve/blit descriptors and validators        (34)
//! record      the internal command sequence and RecordedWork      (38)
//! uses        which resource a command actually touched           (34.6, 37)
//! ```
//!
//! `IndexFormat` is the one type that stays at this root rather than moving into
//! `geometry`, where section 30 groups it: it is named by
//! [`crate::api::pipeline::PrimitiveState::strip_index_format`] (section 25.1), and
//! the pipeline chapter's import reads `crate::api::command::IndexFormat`.
//!
//! The submodules are crate-visible rather than private, for the reason
//! `resource::transfer` states for its own two halves: the validators they own are
//! crate-private entry points, and a `pub(crate) use` of one would be an unused
//! import in a non-test build. A caller outside the crate sees the re-exports
//! below and nothing else.
//!
//! # The invariant this chapter enforces
//!
//! **A recording is a state machine, and the borrow checker is half of it.** A
//! scope holds the recorder mutably, so two scopes cannot be open at once and no
//! command can land outside a scope's interior. The other half is the phase field:
//! a recorder that a dropped scope left unclosed is *poisoned* rather than
//! repaired, because a recording with a hole in it cannot be lowered and pretending
//! otherwise would put a malformed command sequence in front of a driver.
