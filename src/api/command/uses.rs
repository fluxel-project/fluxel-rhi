//! The mapping from a recorded command to the actual uses it produces
//! (specification sections 37.2, 37.3, and 34.6).
//!
//! This module owns one thing: *given a bound resource and the reason a command
//! touched it, which* [`ResourceUse`] *describes that touch*. It is the single
//! place where the access masks of section 37.2's table are written down, so that
//! the raster path and the compute path cannot disagree about what a
//! `StorageBuffer { access: ReadWrite }` costs, and the single place where a
//! copy's direction becomes an access, so that a copy source cannot be read as a
//! write in one verb and a read in another.
//!
//! It also holds the one validation rule the two scopes state identically: section
//! 22.4's dynamic-offset rule, [`require_valid_dynamic_offsets`]. It lives here for
//! the same reason the access masks do — "dynamic offsets valid" is one sentence
//! that section 32.3 and section 33 each quote, so it is written once rather than
//! once per scope.
//!
//! # What this module does not own
//!
//! - When a use happens. Section 32.4 generates actual use at draw and dispatch
//!   and not at the state-setting verbs; that "when" is
//!   [`crate::api::command::raster`]'s, [`crate::api::command::compute`]'s, and
//!   [`crate::api::command::CommandRecorder`]'s.
//! - Upper-layer scheduling contracts. This module records only the portable
//!   commands that actually happened.
//! - Native resource states, barriers, and layouts. A backend lowers those from
//!   these actual uses together with `SubmissionPlan` ordering; exposing a state
//!   transition here would make callers duplicate backend synchronization policy.
//! - Sampler participation. Section 37.2 says a sampler generates no memory
//!   hazard but still enters command semantics; it has no memory or query-slot
//!   `ResourceUse`, so it produces no record here. It is not lost: the
//!   [`crate::api::binding::BindGroup`] that holds it is cloned
//!   into the recorded command, so the sampler is still part of what the command
//!   says.
//!
//! # The invariant this module enforces
//!
//! **Every element of a `Fixed(n)` binding is used.** Section 37.2 permits a
//! smaller element set only when certified metadata proves it, and P0 has no
//! such metadata, so a conservatively-whole use is the only true answer here. A
//! use list that covered one element of a four-element array would let a hazard
//! through, and no later stage could tell that it had.
