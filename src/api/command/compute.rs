//! `ComputeScope` and the compute command set (specification section 33).
//!
//! This module owns the dispatch-shaped half of a recording: a scope with no
//! attachments, a pipeline, bind groups, and workgroup counts.
//!
//! # What this module does not own
//!
//! - Whether the device can compute at all. Section 33 gates the whole chapter on
//!   [`OptionalFeature::Compute`] and that is read from the snapshot the device
//!   interned, so [`CommandRecorder::begin_compute`] refuses rather than lowering
//!   when it is absent.
//! - Whether a workgroup count is within the device's
//!   `MaxComputeWorkgroupsPerDimension`. Also a device fact, read from the same
//!   snapshot, and also a refusal from [`ComputeScope::dispatch`] rather than a
//!   guessed bound.
//! - The workgroup *shape* rules — that a shader's `@workgroup_size` matches what a
//!   pipeline declares. Those belong to the shader artifact's own validator
//!   (section 19.7) and were already applied when the pipeline was created.
//!
//! # The invariant this module enforces
//!
//! **A dispatch is reachable only through a pipeline and a complete set of the
//! groups that pipeline's interface uses.** Both are portable facts, so both are
//! decided here: a dispatch that reached a backend without them would be a
//! backend discovering something the portable layer could have refused, which
//! section 4 forbids.
