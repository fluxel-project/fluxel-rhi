//! Recorded work: the internal command sequence and the opaque
//! [`RecordedWork`] a recorder produces (specification section 38.1 and 38.2).
//!
//! This module owns two things:
//!
//! 1. **The internal command sequence.** What a recorder actually recorded, in
//!    command order, with each command carrying the resource uses it produced.
//!    Section 37.1 keeps that sequence internal *on purpose*: the merged
//!    summary is the public answer, and a caller may not read a
//!    [`ResourceUse`] as proof that a write covered the whole range (section
//!    37.4).
//! 2. **The mapped [`RecordedWork`] summary.** One merged use list, one domain
//!    set, and the identity of the recording.
//!
//! # What this module does not own
//!
//! - Whether a lane accepts the work. Section 40.1's
//!   `lane.domains().contains(work.work_domains())` is the submission plan's
//!   check; this module only reports the domains.
//! - Copy, upload, and readback *validation*. Those verbs live in
//!   [`crate::api::command::copy`]; this module only stores what they recorded.
//!
//! # Strong ownership (section 38.2)
//!
//! A `RecordedWork` holds the logical objects it needs for execution — buffers,
//! textures, views, bind groups, pipelines, the upload payload, and the readback
//! state — by clone. The requirement is section 38.2's: a caller that drops its
//! own handle after recording must not change what is submitted. Every payload
//! below therefore owns its handles rather than borrowing them, and `finish()`
//! consumes the recorder rather than lending from it.
