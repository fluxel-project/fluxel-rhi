//! Acquiring a frame and using it as a render attachment (specification
//! section 44).
//!
//! The frame lifecycle: the refusal vocabulary an acquire reports, the frame's
//! identity and state, the attachment a raster scope draws into, and the
//! non-Clone token that owns the acquired drawable until it is presented or
//! abandoned. It does not own the present outcome (section 45), the lease the
//! frame came from (section 43), or the plan the frame enters (section 39).
//!
//! Invariant: an acquired drawable is owned by exactly one [`AcquiredFrame`], and
//! that ownership ends in exactly one of three ways — the frame enters an accepted
//! present plan, it is explicitly abandoned, or the target or device is lost.
//! Every other exit, including a plain `Drop`, is bookkeeping for the first of
//! those being skipped, not a fourth outcome.
//!
//! ```text
//! Acquired -> PlannedForPresent      by present_after          (45.1)
//! Acquired -> Abandoned              by abandon, or by Drop    (44.4, 44.5)
//! PlannedForPresent -> Abandoned     by Drop, when no plan was submitted  (41.9)
//! any      -> Outdated/TargetLost/DeviceLost                   (44.2, 45.5)
//! ```
//!
//! A `FrameAttachment` is not an ownership token and never becomes one: it may be
//! cloned freely, and `validate_frame_attachment_use` is the rule that keeps a
//! stale one out of a recording.
//!
//! The frame and the lease it came from meet at one shared record — the lease's record
//! of the frame it has out — and it is the only thing a frame holds that points back at
//! its lease. Section 44.5 requires a dropped frame to mark its
//! [`ConfiguredPresentation`]; a frame that ended unaccounted for would leave the lease
//! answering section 43.4's refusal forever, which is the state section 46.3 forbids.
//! This token has no lease reference to do that with, and is not given one: it is moved
//! into the plan builder and outlives arbitrary lease scopes. Reporting its ending to
//! the shared record is the whole of the link, and it is a report rather than ownership
//! — the frame still does not own the lease, and the lease is still not a thing a frame
//! may reach into.
