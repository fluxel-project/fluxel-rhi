//! Statistics — portable logical statistics (specification section 47).
//!
//! **This file is being written in specification order** and is the root of the
//! statistics chapter. It owns the device-scoped service, the collection-detail
//! and collection-epoch model, and the two device verbs that turn a collected
//! observation into a number a caller can read. The frozen metric definitions
//! themselves are split along section seams into the submodules below:
//!
//! ```text
//! counters   47.5 - 47.8, 47.10 - 47.12   the cumulative and interval counters
//! snapshot   47.4, 47.9, 47.13            consistency, the interval delta, the
//!                                         frame sampler
//! inventory  47.14 - 47.18                live inventory and the logical memory
//!                                         estimate
//! ```
//!
//! The split is a size decision, not a responsibility decision: section 47 is
//! one chapter with one subject, and the seams are the section boundaries the
//! specification already draws.
//!
//! # What statistics are
//!
//! Counts and durations the RHI observed about **its own portable work**: the
//! commands it was asked to record, the state changes that were effective, the
//! structure of what was submitted, the presentation lifecycle, the logical
//! object lifecycle, the live inventory, a descriptor-based byte estimate, and a
//! caller-defined sampling interval.
//!
//! # What statistics are not
//!
//! Section 47.1 freezes the boundary, and the boundary is the point of the
//! chapter. Statistics are **not**:
//!
//! ```text
//! native barrier count            actual queue overlap
//! native descriptor bind count    driver PSO cache hit/miss
//! native command buffer count     hardware counters / occupancy / cache misses
//! native queue switch             actual VRAM allocation / residency / fragmentation
//!                                 GPU timestamp / frame time
//!                                 display scan-out FPS
//! ```
//!
//! Those arrive later, independently, from a query surface, backend tooling, an
//! allocator telemetry channel, and present timing. A backend that reported a
//! native number through this chapter would make two backends incomparable while
//! looking comparable, which is worse than reporting nothing.
//!
//! Two consequences a reader should keep in mind:
//!
//! - A statistic that reads zero is not evidence that nothing happened. A
//!   counter is only collected at the detail level that includes it, and only
//!   for work the RHI was told about.
//! - Statistics never change RHI semantics. Section 47.19 lists what an
//!   implementation may do (recorder-local counters, merge at `finish()`, merge
//!   at submission, versioned lifecycle inventory, local unique sets) and what
//!   it may not (insert GPU commands or barriers, wait for the GPU, change lane
//!   assignment or graph culling or aliasing or present behaviour, serialize
//!   parallel recorders). Turning statistics on may cost CPU time and memory and
//!   may cost nothing else.
//!
//! # Device scope
//!
//! Each [`DeviceIdentity`] has an independent statistics domain and there is no
//! global singleton. A caller running two devices aggregates the two snapshots
//! itself; the RHI does not combine them into one counter, because a combined
//! number would have no owner and no epoch.
