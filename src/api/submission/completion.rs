//! Completion of submitted work (specification section 41).
//!
//! The other half of acceptance: what a caller can learn after a plan was
//! submitted — the two completion levels a plan reports, the terminal states those
//! can reach, and the receipt that carries them. It does not own the plan
//! (section 39), the frames a plan presents ([`crate::api::presentation`] owns the
//! outcome of those), or the retirement bookkeeping that consumes this state
//! (section 41.6, which is an internal RHI property and has no verb here).
//!
//! Invariant, and section 41.3 calls it a critical frozen semantic:
//!
//! ```text
//! Device::submit returning Ok     means the RHI entered "accepted submission"
//! Device::submit returning Err    means no GPU work in the plan was accepted
//! ```
//!
//! There is no third outcome. Once any native work has been accepted, a later
//! failure — a lane that cannot continue, a lost device — is reported *through*
//! the receipt as `CompletionState::Failed` or `DeviceLost`, never as `Err`. The
//! case this forbids is the one where a batch runs on the GPU while the caller is
//! told the whole plan did not execute.
//!
//! ```text
//! accepted  != complete                                       (41.7)
//! no blocking wait in the frame loop                          (41.10)
//! device loss reaches every pending point, and never stays Pending   (41.8)
//! ```
