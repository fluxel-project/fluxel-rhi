//! The submission plan builder and the validation that produces a plan
//! (specification section 40).
//!
//! What a caller assembles before anything is submitted: batches on logical lanes,
//! happens-before edges between them, edges from already-submitted work, and the
//! frames a plan presents. It does not own the plan's identity or its validated
//! shape ([`super::plan`]), the accepted-work bookkeeping a submission produces
//! ([`super::completion`]), or the frames themselves
//! ([`crate::api::presentation`] owns the frame lifecycle, and this builder only
//! takes ownership of one).
//!
//! Invariant, and the reason this type is not just a `Vec` of batches:
//!
//! ```text
//! a plan that exists has passed every check build() can make        (40.5)
//! two batches with no happens-before between them may not conflict   (40.4)
//! a frame is used only inside the closure that presents it           (45.3)
//! ```
//!
//! # Which check happens when
//!
//! Section 40.5 lists ten checks that must be complete *before any native
//! submission*, and section 41.3 puts the same list in `Device::submit`'s Phase A.
//! They are not all decidable in the same place, and saying which is which is the
//! point of this file:
//!
//! ```text
//! insertion time   batch rules, point ownership, lane route, frame ownership
//! build()          the dependency graph, the hazard analysis, the frame closure
//! submit() Phase A identity, liveness, and the cross-plan hazard of section 41.4
//! the backend      whether an external dependency's route can actually be proven
//! ```
//!
//! The last line is the one gap that is not an omission: section 40.3 asks whether
//! the *source* and destination execution domains can be ordered, and a
//! [`CompletionPoint`] carries no lane — only a device and a serial (section 39.2).
//! The source lane of a plan that already ran is accepted-work history the backend
//! keeps, so `add_external_dependency` records the edge and its device identity
//! check is the part this layer can prove. See its documentation.
//!
//! # Two constructors
//!
//! [`SubmissionPlanBuilder::new`] is the public one and reads two facts off the
//! device handle rather than taking them from the caller: the device's lane table
//! and a device-scoped plan serial. Both are device state — section 40.1 decides
//! against the first and section 39.1 mints from the second — so a caller that
//! supplied either could construct a plan the device would never have issued.
//! The crate-private `with_facts` is the one that actually takes them, and it is
//! what `new` calls and what the contract tests drive.
//!
//! Notably absent from `new`: the plan serial. It is *drawn* from the device, not
//! taken even implicitly, because section 39.1's uniqueness rule is per device and
//! can only hold if one counter serves every builder over it.
