//! Submission plan identity, and the validated plan itself (specification
//! sections 39 and 40).
//!
//! What this file owns: the identity of a plan, the identity of a batch inside it,
//! the point that names a batch, the two tokens a submitted plan hands back —
//! acceptance ([`SubmissionPoint`]) and terminal GPU completion
//! ([`CompletionPoint`]) — and the validated body of a plan, which is what
//! `Device::submit` lowers. What it does not own: *building* a plan
//! ([`crate::api::submission::SubmissionPlanBuilder`] and section 40's rules live
//! in `builder.rs`), recorded work (module 04's `RecordedWork`, which a batch
//! carries), the receipt and completion state of a submitted plan (section 41, in
//! `completion.rs`), and any native submission machinery — section 39's opening
//! list forbids a queue, fence, semaphore, event, or timeline value from appearing
//! in this surface at all.
//!
//! Invariant: a plan identity is minted by the builder that owns it and names the
//! device it will be submitted to, so a `PlanPoint` from one builder can never be
//! accepted by another (section 39.1) and no caller can forge one — the fields are
//! private, there is no public constructor, and batch numbering is not something a
//! caller can start at zero to slip past the check.
