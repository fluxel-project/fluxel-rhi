//! Specification section 55: the captured mutation and command values.
//!
//! One responsibility: **the values a recorded command carries that are not
//! object definitions.** Section 54 describes things that exist; this file
//! describes things that *happened* — an attachment set, a copy, a resolve, a
//! blit, an upload, a readback request. Together with section 56's command IR
//! they are what a Replay feeds back into the normal RHI API.
//!
//! Not owned here: the commands that hold these values ([`super::work`]), the
//! object definitions they refer to ([`super::definition`]), and the live
//! recorder that produced them (`api::command`, module 04). Every type below is
//! built from that module's vocabulary rather than from a second copy of it: an
//! attachment *is* a [`LoadOp`] and a [`StoreOp`], a copy is a pair of
//! [`ObjectId`]s and a byte count, and none of those concepts needs a tooling
//! spelling.
//!
//! # The rule that decides every difference from the live types
//!
//! A captured value **preserves everything that determines the GPU result, and
//! may drop what is diagnostic only.** Two places in this file apply that rule
//! and they pull in opposite directions, so it is worth stating before either:
//!
//! * [`CapturedResolve`] **gains** `src_origin` and `dst_origin` relative to
//!   section 55.2's field list. The live
//!   [`crate::api::command::TextureResolve`] carries them, root specification
//!   section 4 corrected the chapter to require explicit origins, and a resolve
//!   of a sub-region that the record could not name is a resolve that replays to
//!   a different image. That is not a diagnostic loss, it is a wrong result.
//! * [`CapturedReadbackRequest`] **keeps** section 55.3's list exactly, which
//!   means it drops the `Label` the live
//!   [`crate::api::resource::transfer::ReadbackRequest`] carries on both variants.
//!   A label is excluded from every canonical hash and decides nothing; a record
//!   that omits it is a record whose debug name for its own checkpoint is gone,
//!   which is a real but acceptable loss under the rule above.
//!
//! # Two more deliberate shape differences
//!
//! * [`CapturedColorAttachment::load`] is a `LoadOp<ColorClearValue>` and not
//!   section 55.1's `LoadOp<Color>`. `Color` is this crate's *blend constant*
//!   type (four floats) and `ColorClearValue` is the attachment clear value,
//!   which also covers the signed- and unsigned-integer attachment formats. The
//!   live [`crate::api::command::ColorAttachment`] uses `ColorClearValue`, so a
//!   captured value typed `Color` could neither be produced from the live one nor
//!   replay an integer clear.
//! * [`CapturedRasterScope`] keeps the live scope's shape — a
//!   `Vec<Option<...>>` indexed by attachment location with `None` for a hole —
//!   rather than a dense list, because section 26's canonicalization removes
//!   trailing holes only. A dense list would silently renumber a deferred
//!   renderer's locations 0 and 3 into 0 and 1.
