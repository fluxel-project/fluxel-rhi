//! Samplers (specification sections 16.1 and 16.2).
//!
//! A sampler is created once and may be bound many times. This module owns the
//! addressing modes, filters, comparison function, and descriptor that a caller
//! states, the opaque object that results, and the portable rules the descriptor
//! must satisfy.
//!
//! # What this module does not own
//!
//! - The *binding* contract a sampler takes part in — section 16.1's
//!   `SamplerKind` table, which distinguishes a comparison sampler from a
//!   non-filtering one from a filtering one — is the binding chapter's
//!   (section 20). `SamplerKind` describes what a shader interface requires of a
//!   sampler, which is a fact about the binding, not about the descriptor: the
//!   same `SamplerDescriptor` may be bound as a filtering sampler in one place
//!   and fail to satisfy a non-filtering interface in another, and that verdict
//!   belongs where the interface is known.
//! - Whether a texture may be sampled through this sampler is decided by the
//!   binding of the pair, not here.
//! - Backend-specific sampler objects and texture-state lowering are explicitly
//!   implementation details (section 16.1), so nothing in this module exposes
//!   one.
//!
//! # The one capability this descriptor can need
//!
//! Anisotropy is not a base capability: on WebGL2 it comes from an extension
//! (section 16.1), so a descriptor asking for `max_anisotropy > 1` is asking for
//! an *optional feature* to have been enabled, and for a value at or below the
//! device's maximum. Both halves are checked by
//! `validate_sampler_anisotropy`, which takes the two device facts as
//! parameters. The types that carry those facts (`OptionalFeature`, `LimitKey`)
//! exist — they are [`crate::api::platform::requirements`]'s and are read through
//! [`crate::api::capability::EnabledCapabilities`] — but the *answers* are probed
//! device state, so they arrive with the backend port rather than here. That is
//! why [`Device::create_sampler`] names this rule in its stop instead of checking
//! it: the descriptor half of section 16.1 is decidable now, this half is not.
