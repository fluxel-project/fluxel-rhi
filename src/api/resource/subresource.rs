//! Aspects, subresource ranges, origins, and host texel layout (specification
//! sections 14.1 through 14.5).
//!
//! This module owns the vocabulary that says *which part* of a texture an
//! operation touches, and in which byte layout a caller's CPU bytes are stored.
//!
//! # Why tracking and copy use different types
//!
//! Section 14 opens by requiring two shapes rather than one, and the split is
//! load-bearing:
//!
//! ```text
//! TextureSubresourceRange    view / hazard tracking: many mips x many layers
//! TextureSubresourceLayers   copy / upload / readback: one mip x a layer range
//! ```
//!
//! A hazard range and a copy region are not the same set even when they name the
//! same texels: a copy touches one mip level per operation because a native copy
//! region has one, while a tracked hazard may span the whole mip chain. One
//! shared type would have to be legal in the union of both situations, which
//! means it would accept states neither native API can express.
//!
//! # Array layers and Z slices are not the same axis
//!
//! Section 14.4 forbids folding them into one `depth_or_layers` field, and the
//! rules say why: a 2D array layer is addressed by
//! [`TextureSubresourceLayers`], while a 3D texture's Z slice is addressed by
//! [`Origin3d`] plus [`Extent3d`], and a 3D texture's layer is pinned to `0/1`.
//! A single fused field would make "layer 3 of a 3D texture" expressible, and it
//! is not a thing.
//!
//! # What this module does not own
//!
//! - Whether the *format* of a given aspect may be created, sampled, or attached
//!   is [`crate::api::format::FormatFacts`].
//! - Whether the GPU-side copy route exists, and what alignment the native copy
//!   buffer requires, is [`crate::api::resource::route`]. The distinction is
//!   section 14.5's whole point: [`HostTexelLayout`] describes *caller bytes*,
//!   and `RouteSupport::texel_copy_layout` describes the *GPU route*. They are
//!   deliberately not the same numbers, and the upload path may repack one into
//!   the other without telling the caller.
