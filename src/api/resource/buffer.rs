//! Buffer usage, support, descriptor, object, and range (specification sections
//! 11.1, 11.2, and 12.1 through 12.4).
//!
//! A P0 buffer is byte-addressed and opaque. This module owns what a caller may
//! state about one before it exists ([`BufferDescriptor`]), what the device
//! answers about a usage combination ([`BufferSupport`]), and what a caller may
//! learn about one afterwards ([`Buffer`]'s accessors).
//!
//! # What this module does not own
//!
//! - Whether a *copy route* between two buffers is legal is
//!   [`crate::api::resource::route`], not a buffer fact. Section 12.1 gives the
//!   reason the buffer needs its own query anyway: on a backend where storage
//!   buffers do not exist, `BufferSupportQuery::new(BufferUsage::STORAGE)` must
//!   answer `Unsupported` up front, instead of creating the buffer and failing
//!   later at a bind group — which is the same "no second set of conditions"
//!   rule the texture chapter applies to its own query.
//! - A buffer's contents and host visibility do not appear in its descriptor.
//!   Explicit host mapping is a separate asynchronous lease in
//!   [`crate::api::resource::mapping`]; upload and readback remain the two
//!   transfer facilities in [`crate::api::resource::transfer`].
//! - The element stride is not here either. Section 12.2 deletes
//!   `element_stride_hint` because a byte-addressed P0 buffer has no elements,
//!   and a structured stride belongs to a future `BufferView`.
//!
//! # Validation
//!
//! The portable rules are `validate_buffer_descriptor` and
//! `validate_buffer_range`. They take the capability answers they need as
//! parameters rather than reading a device, which keeps the rule decidable
//! without a backend (root section 4) and testable without a GPU.
