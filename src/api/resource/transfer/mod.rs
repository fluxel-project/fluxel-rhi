//! Upload jobs and readback tickets (specification sections 17.1 through 18.8).
//!
//! The two host-boundary workflows of P0, and the module where the resource
//! chapter's lifetime rules become observable.
//!
//! ```text
//! upload     caller bytes -> Device::create_*_upload -> UploadJob
//!            -> CommandRecorder::encode_upload -> submitted work
//! readback   ReadbackRequest -> CommandRecorder::encode_readback -> ReadbackTicket
//!            -> terminal completion -> ReadbackView (scoped CPU read)
//! ```
//!
//! # Upload is a workflow, not a copy command
//!
//! Section 17 says so to close one loophole: a `UploadJob` may repack caller
//! bytes into a private staging buffer, because section 14.5's
//! [`HostTexelLayout`](crate::api::resource::HostTexelLayout) describes CPU
//! bytes rather than the 256-byte row pitch a native copy footprint wants.
//! What it may *not* do is apply the same trick on
//! the readback side of a command — the repack is host-to-GPU staging that
//! upload itself promises, not a backend silently turning a copy into a
//! round-trip (section 9.4's rule).
//!
//! # Readback is not map-immediately
//!
//! Section 18's chain is the reason [`ReadbackTicket`] is a token rather than a
//! future: the caller encodes a request, submits the work through a recorder,
//! advances the device (`Device::poll`) until the GPU work is terminal, and only
//! then may read. The ticket never spins or waits on the GPU itself, and its
//! state machine cannot rest permanently in `NotSubmitted` or `Pending` —
//! section 18.2 makes those two transient, which is what stops a lost device
//! from leaving a caller waiting forever (section 18.7).
//!
//! # What this module does not own
//!
//! - The two encode verbs. Section 18.5 declares them on `CommandRecorder`,
//!   which is the command chapter's type; see this crate's `0.16` series audit
//!   (A7) for the adjudication that puts them there.
//! - Completion points. The type belongs to `submission`
//!   ([`crate::api::submission::CompletionPoint`]) and the value belongs to the
//!   device: [`ReadbackTicket::completion`] reports the point a successful
//!   submission recorded, and `None` before one does, because a ticket must not
//!   mint a point for work the device has not accepted.
//! - Retirement bookkeeping. Section 18.6 states the rule — native backing must
//!   outlive the last logical owner *and* all terminal GPU work — and it belongs
//!   to the device, not to a token in this module: a ticket records a completion
//!   point, and only the device can know when the last logical owner and the last
//!   terminal GPU work have both passed. The bookkeeping that enforces it arrives
//!   with the backend port; nothing in this tree enforces it today.
//!
//! The two workflows live in their own files — upload in `upload` and
//! readback in `readback` — because section 17 and section 18 are
//! separately specified, separately encoded, and separately consumed. This
//! file is the composition entry point: it re-exports both halves at the module
//! path callers already use, and owns the one rule they share.
//!
//! Both halves stay crate-visible rather than private because the validators they
//! own are crate-private entry points of their own. Callers name the defining
//! module directly so ownership remains visible.
