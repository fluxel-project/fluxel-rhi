//! Texture views (specification sections 15.1 through 15.3).
//!
//! A view is the only way to hand a texture to a shader, an attachment, or a
//! storage binding. This module owns the view dimension, the descriptor that
//! selects a subresource range and an optional alternate format, and the opaque
//! object that results.
//!
//! # Two different questions, two different places
//!
//! Section 8.5 splits view legality, and this module is one half of the split:
//!
//! ```text
//! can this format legally reinterpret that one?   EnabledCapabilities
//!                                                 ::texture_view_format_compatible
//! may this descriptor ask for it?                 validate_texture_view_descriptor
//! ```
//!
//! The first is a device fact (some pairs of formats are reinterpretable on one
//! driver and not another), and it is owned by module 01. The second is
//! portable: whether the base texture *declared* the view format when it was
//! created, whether the aspect is one the base format has at all, whether the
//! mip/layer range exists, and whether the view dimension is compatible with the
//! texture's. Section 8.5 assigns both to `create_texture_view` validation and
//! says neither may be skipped, so this module checks the portable half and
//! names the device half rather than guessing at it.
//!
//! # What this module does not own
//!
//! - Whether a *binding* of the resulting view is legal is the binding chapter
//!   (section 20): P0 has no sampled stencil semantics, and that is a fact about
//!   which shader interface the view is bound to, not about the view.
//! - The subresource vocabulary itself is
//!   [`crate::api::resource::subresource`].
