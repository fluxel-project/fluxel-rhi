//! Route facts: whether a portable operation has a legal direct backend path
//! (specification sections 9.1 through 9.4).
//!
//! The chapter answers exactly one question, and section 9 writes it as a
//! warning because the question is easy to answer wrongly:
//!
//! ```text
//! asked:      does this operation have a legal direct RHI route?
//! NOT asked:  can the backend secretly replace it with a shader or a
//!             CPU round-trip?
//! ```
//!
//! # The fallback rule, which is a contract rather than a policy
//!
//! Section 9.4 freezes the answer, and it is the reason this module is not
//! optional machinery:
//!
//! ```text
//! RouteSupport::Unsupported  =>  the command returns Unsupported
//! ```
//!
//! A backend may not, without the caller knowing, lower a blit into a fullscreen
//! shader, a copy into a staging CPU round-trip, or a resolve into a compute
//! shader. If a caller wants a fallback, the caller queries the route and
//! selects another explicit graph pass or command route. The payoff is that
//! capture, statistics, and the performance model describe what was actually
//! executed instead of what was nominally requested — which is exactly what a
//! silent fallback would corrupt.
//!
//! # Why the key carries shape
//!
//! Section 9.1 puts texture dimension, format, and aspect in the key, and
//! sample counts for the two texture-to-texture routes, because otherwise the
//! gap it names opens: a route that answers `Supported` for a key that does not
//! include those facts will be asked to execute a descriptor it cannot, and the
//! failure lands on a driver instead of on portable validation.
//!
//! Buffer-to-texture and texture-to-buffer routes are single-sample only in P0;
//! that is enforced jointly by the texture query (a multisampled texture cannot
//! be a copy destination for these routes) and command validation.
//!
//! # Where the blit key's filter comes from
//!
//! Section 9.1's [`RouteQuery::Blit`] carries `filter: BlitFilter`, and that type
//! is owned by section 34.5 in the recording chapter
//! ([`crate::api::command::BlitFilter`]) rather than re-declared here: the filter
//! is what a *blit command* asks for, and this module only names it in a key. The
//! import is one-way — `route` reads `command`, never the reverse — so a caller
//! can build a blit key without a device and the two chapters cannot drift into
//! two spellings of `Linear`.
