//! Texture usage, shape, creation compatibility, descriptor, and object
//! (specification sections 11.1 and 13.1 through 13.4).
//!
//! This module owns one chapter: what a caller may state about a texture before
//! it exists, and what may be learned about one afterwards.
//!
//! # What this module does not own
//!
//! - Whether the device can create it is
//!   [`crate::api::format::TextureSupport`], which owns the descriptor-dependent
//!   query and its limits. This module *asks* it
//!   (`validate_texture_descriptor`) rather than restating its rules, because
//!   section 13.3 forbids the three-sets-of-conditions mistake: the capability
//!   query, the creation validation, and the backend's image creation must
//!   consult one description, not three.
//! - Whether a *view* of it is legal is
//!   [`crate::api::resource::view`], which is the only code that knows the
//!   aspect, dimension, and range the view will actually use.
//! - Subresource ranges, origins, and host byte layout are
//!   [`crate::api::resource::subresource`], because the copy/tracking vocabulary
//!   is shared with upload and readback and is not a texture property.
//!
//! # The three questions that look like one
//!
//! Section 13 keeps them apart, and the separation is the reason the descriptor
//! is shaped the way it is:
//!
//! ```text
//! portable invariants        "is this descriptor self-consistent?"
//!                            (extent vs dimension, mips vs extent, CUBE intent)
//! capability query           "can this device make one?"
//!                            (section 8.3, keyed on dimension/format/usage/samples)
//! creation limits            "is this extent/mip/layer count within the ceiling?"
//! ```
//!
//! A descriptor that fails the first is wrong everywhere; one that fails the
//! second is wrong on this device; one that fails the third is too large here.
//! Collapsing them would make a portable rule report itself as a device
//! limitation.
