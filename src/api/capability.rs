//! Capability facts (specification section 7).
//!
//! Capability is not a bag of booleans. Section 7 defines it as a fact database
//! at three levels, and this module owns exactly those three:
//!
//! ```text
//! AvailableCapabilities     what the selected adapter could do
//! EnabledCapabilities       what the created device actually got
//! DeviceLimits              the limit subset of the enabled facts
//! ```
//!
//! The shape is the point. Section 7.3 forbids collapsing this into
//! `HardwareCapabilities { supports_x: bool, .. }`, because every fact must have
//! exactly one canonical source: texture dimension, usage, and sample count are
//! answered by a [`TextureSupportQuery`]; per-stage resource counts by
//! [`EnabledCapabilities::binding_limit`]; binding kind, count, and
//! dynamic-offset legality by a [`BindingSupportQuery`]; format specifics by
//! [`FormatFacts`]; presentation by surface facts. A second `supports_*` boolean
//! for any of those is a defect, not a convenience.
//!
//! # What this module does not own
//!
//! The *vocabulary* of a fact stays with the thing the fact describes — the
//! buffer and texture query types in [`crate::api::resource`], the format facts
//! in [`crate::api::format`], the binding queries in [`crate::api::binding`], and
//! the feature and limit keys in [`crate::api::platform::requirements`]. This
//! module owns only the database that answers them, so a caller comparing what
//! was available against what was enabled learns one shape rather than two.
//!
//! Presentation facts are deliberately absent. Section 7 scopes them to a
//! `(Device, PresentationTarget)` pair rather than to a device, which is why they
//! are a query in [`crate::api::presentation`] and not a field here. A device-wide
//! "presentation capabilities" value would be the degenerate form section 7
//! rules out, because one device can serve two targets with different answers.
//!
//! # Four shapes of answer, and the rule that chooses between two of them
//!
//! The accessors below do not all treat "enumeration did not record this" the same
//! way, and the difference is not taste. The rule is:
//!
//! > **A recorded key must be drawn from a space a backend can walk in full.**
//! > Where it is, an absent entry is a hole in enumeration. Where it is not, an
//! > absent entry is an answer.
//!
//! It is worth stating why that is the rule rather than "always be conservative".
//! A hole and an answer are different failures: a hole costs a capability and is
//! found by whoever needed it, while a hole read as `Supported` permits an
//! operation the device cannot perform and is found by a driver, later, somewhere
//! else. Only one of those is recoverable, so where the two cannot be told apart
//! the answer must be the conservative one — but where they *can* be told apart,
//! collapsing them would delete a bug detector that costs nothing to keep.
//!
//! The four shapes, in the order they appear below:
//!
//! 1. **`Option<V>`, where `None` is a real answer.** [`EnabledCapabilities::format`]
//!    answers `Option<FormatFacts>`. Section 7.2 gives the case that makes the
//!    distinction load-bearing — a WebGPU adapter may report a format as available
//!    while the created device reports it as unavailable, and that is legal as long
//!    as the device was created without enabling the format's required semantics.
//! 2. **Membership in a recorded relation.** [`EnabledCapabilities::supports_feature`]
//!    and [`EnabledCapabilities::texture_view_format_compatible`] answer membership,
//!    so an absent entry *is* the honest negative: a feature the device did not
//!    enable is not enabled, and a format pair enumeration did not list is not
//!    compatible. Both relations are recorded positively, and the direction is the
//!    safe one — this negative refuses an operation, so a hole here costs a
//!    capability rather than permitting something a driver would reject.
//! 3. **A negative-variant answer over an enumerable key.** [`EnabledCapabilities::buffer_support`]
//!    answers a support enum, and its key space is [`BufferUsage`]'s sixty-four
//!    masks — a set a backend can record in full. So an absent entry here is not an
//!    answer to anything: it means enumeration never asked. Answering `Supported`
//!    would be a lie and answering `Unsupported` would be a *different* lie that
//!    nobody would ever trace back to enumeration, so the query panics and names
//!    itself. A backend that leaves a hole in this snapshot has a bug, and section
//!    6.9's rule that a portable defect may not be left for a driver to discover
//!    cuts the same way.
//! 4. **A support enum whose answers no single enumeration settles.**
//!    [`EnabledCapabilities::route`] answers a support enum over keys carrying a
//!    sample count, which has no last element a backend could stop at; there is no
//!    enumeration that could have been complete, so an absent entry cannot be a
//!    hole, and the query answers its negative instead of panicking.
//!    [`EnabledCapabilities::texture_support`] and
//!    [`EnabledCapabilities::binding_support`] are here for that reason too, and
//!    for a second one that outlives it: each is answered at *both* capability
//!    levels, and an adapter-level snapshot has no device to ask, so its answer is
//!    the negative whether or not the key space is walkable. The recorded binding
//!    key is what narrowed the second of those to a finite space; a shape-3 panic
//!    there would land on every adapter instead of on a backend that forgot to fill
//!    a table, which is a bug detector pointed at the wrong party.
//!
//! # What shape 4 costs, and what is done about it
//!
//! Shape 4 trades a bug detector for a correct answer, and it is worth naming the
//! price instead of leaving it implied: a backend that neglects to record a texture
//! format will not panic anywhere, it will refuse textures in that format, and the
//! symptom will look like a driver limitation.
//!
//! Two things keep that from being guesswork. The view-formats field — the one
//! unbounded component that is a *list* rather than a number — is not in the key at
//! all: the recorded key type drops it, and the query answers it from the
//! pairwise relation of shape 2, which is already recorded and already has the
//! right default. And the mock backend's conformance suite records a full snapshot,
//! so a fill that is incomplete in a way that matters shows up as a mock-versus-
//! native disagreement rather than as a mystery on one machine.
//!
//! # Why the snapshot is data rather than `unimplemented!()`
//!
//! Every accessor in this module is a lookup over facts the backend recorded
//! during enumeration. Writing them as panics would leave the *shape* of the
//! interface unreviewable — the tests in `api::tests::capability` exist to answer
//! "can a caller compare available against enabled without learning two
//! vocabularies", and they cannot answer it against a panic. The storage below is
//! crate-private and is what the backend port fills; the public contract is the
//! accessor list, which is transcribed from section 7.2 unchanged.

/// live now, delete the crutch". That is what happened, and it happened in
/// several parts rather than one — which is the useful part of the story.
///
/// The form the arrival takes is a *narrowing* rather than a deletion: `not(test)`
/// becomes `all(not(test), not(feature = "dx12"))`. A build without the `dx12`
/// feature still compiles these methods with no caller at all, so the expectation
/// is the true statement about that build rather than a crutch being left behind;
/// what the arrival deletes is the *claim* that the DX12 fill has not landed, and
/// that claim lives in the reason string, which is rewritten in the same commit
/// that gives the method its caller. An `expect` whose reason has stopped being
/// true is the failure mode [`Self::record_feature`]'s own reason string was
/// written to announce.
///
/// The block holds ten methods: the nine it started with, plus
/// [`Self::record_code_form`]. Eight of them have made that move
/// ([`Self::record_feature`], [`Self::record_limit`], [`Self::record_format`],
/// [`Self::record_buffer_support`], [`Self::record_texture_support`],
/// [`Self::record_binding_support`], [`Self::record_route`], and
/// [`Self::record_code_form`]): they are reached from a non-test build by
/// `crate::backend::dx12::facts`.
///
/// Two still have no caller outside this crate's tests, and they are not the same
/// kind of gap:
///
/// - [`Self::record_binding_limit`]'s own doc explains why no Direct3D 12 backend
///   will ever call it: this device states no per-stage, per-class binding ceiling,
///   so an entry here would be this port inventing one.
/// - [`Self::record_view_compatibility`] is the fill that has not landed yet.
///
/// One expectation per method is what keeps the signal working when the block
/// splits, and this block has now split five times: each time the method that moved
/// lost its expectation and the ones that had not kept theirs — the crutch was
/// still there to be removed a method at a time, which is exactly what per-method
