//! Section 23.1-23.2: `PipelineInterface` and its descriptor.
//!
//! The interface is the contract between shader entry points and bind-group
//! packets: the caller's ordered group-layout sequence, kept in order because
//! group numbering is semantic, plus the two tokens of section 23.2 that describe
//! it. This file owns the 23.1 aggregate-count validator and nothing else.
//!
//! Not owned here: section 23.3's requirement merge (`resources.rs`) and the
//! pipelines that consume an interface (`raster.rs`, `compute.rs`). The
//! interface states what a pipeline must satisfy; the pipeline is where it is
//! checked, so no rule about a specific pipeline appears below.
