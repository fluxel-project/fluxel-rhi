//! Sections 29 through 38: recording and actual resource uses.
//!
//! The chapter's tests are split the same way its submodules are, and for the same
//! reason: the recorder's state machine, the attachment set, the draw verbs, the
//! dispatch verb, and the copy and transfer verbs are separately specified and
//! separately refusable. One file per group keeps a reader's working set to the
//! rules that actually interact.
//!
//! Every test names the rule it drives and asserts the exact
//! [`RhiErrorKind`](crate::api::error::RhiErrorKind), because the kind is the part
//! a caller branches on — `InvalidUsage` means "you described this wrongly",
//! `WrongDevice` means "this belongs to another device", `IncompatibleInterface`
//! means "these two agree on nothing", and `Unsupported` means "this device cannot
//! do it". A test that accepted any error would not notice the difference.
//!
//! Two conventions run through the whole group:
//!
//! * Objects are assembled through the crate-private constructors the device verbs
//!   will call, the same way `tests/resource/*` does. A test that could not name an
//!   object could not test what an accessor reports about it.
//! * A device-dependent question is answered by stating a device answer, not by
//!   asserting that the verb stopped. [`recorder_reporting`] builds a device that
//!   reports exactly the facts a test names and hands the recorder *its* snapshot,
//!   so a refusal here is the verb reading a device's own table. The devices in
//!   this chapter that report nothing are the ones that make "this device cannot"
//!   observable as [`RhiErrorKind::Unsupported`].
