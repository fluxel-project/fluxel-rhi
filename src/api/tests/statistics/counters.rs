//! Counter-record tests (specification 47.5–47.8 and 47.10–47.12).
//!
//! Every type in this file is a plain record of named `u64` fields with no
//! methods, so there is no behaviour to drive. What is worth testing is therefore
//! not what the counters *do* — the recorder that increments them does not exist
//! — but what the records *say*: that a caller can read a named field without
//! going through a map, that the groups stay separate rather than flattening into
//! one struct of sixty fields, and that the boundaries the chapter draws (calls
//! versus changes, planned versus accepted, acquire refusal versus present
//! outcome) are drawn in the type rather than left to a reader's memory.
//!
//! Section 47.21's note on scope applies to all of it: a counter that reads zero
//! here reads zero because nothing was ever recorded. None of these tests is
//! evidence that anything happened, and none of them is GPU evidence.
