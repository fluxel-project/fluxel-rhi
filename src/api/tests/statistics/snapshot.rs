//! Snapshot, interval, and sampler tests (specification 47.4, 47.9, and 47.13).
//!
//! This is the half of section 47 that is tested behaviourally rather than read
//! as a shape, because the portable rules it contains are decidable without a
//! backend: which two snapshots may be subtracted, and what the sampling rate of
//! an interval is. The counters themselves arrive from a recorder that does not
//! exist, so [`StatisticsSnapshot::new`] is the crate-private constructor the
//! collection domain will call, and the tests build snapshots through it the way
//! the tests for the resource chapters build buffers through theirs.
//!
//! What the chapter needs and what it has do not line up in one place, and the
//! `#[should_panic]` test below is where that shows: [`IntervalStatistics`]
//! requires per-lane rows and a working set, and a [`StatisticsSnapshot`] carries
//! neither. The verb refuses portably and then panics rather than returning an
//! interval with an empty lane list, which would state that no lane was used.
