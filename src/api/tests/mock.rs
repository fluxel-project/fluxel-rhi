//! The CPU/mock backend for portable API conformance tests.
//!
//! `version-plan.md` section 4 requires a "CPU/mock conformance suite shared by
//! all three backends" as proof for 0.16, and this module is the backend half of
//! it. It exists for a specific reason rather than for convenience: most of the
//! portable contract is decidable without hardware, and a contract rule that can
//! only be checked on a machine with a discrete GPU is a rule that will be broken
//! by the next change. A backend that answers from memory makes those rules
//! testable everywhere, on every platform, in the same run as everything else.
//!
//! It is a **mock and not a reference implementation**, and the difference
//! matters for what it may be used to prove. It performs no lowering, holds no
//! native object, and has no opinion about GPUs; it cannot show that anything is
//! correct on hardware, and `CLAUDE.md` section 4.8 forbids the reverse reading —
//! a mock or a `TestRhi` must never stand in for real-GPU correctness. What it
//! can show, and what it is here to show, is that the portable layer's decisions
//! are made in the portable layer.
//!
//! # Scope limits, recorded rather than implied
//!
//! Where its capability table answers completely and where it does not, so that
//! neither reading is left to be guessed:
//!
//! - **Complete where an answer is a finite decision.** `supports_feature`,
//!   `limit`, `limits`, `format`, `submission`, `compatibility_id`, and
//!   `fingerprint` all answer from a table that a test fills in whole. A test that
//!   wants a device with facts asks for them by name
//!   ([`MockDevice::with_capabilities`]), so the contract under examination is
//!   visible in the test rather than implied by a default.
//! - **It records no support answers at all, and what that costs is not uniform.**
//!   This backend probes nothing, so its support tables are empty, and the four
//!   accessors answer an empty table in the two ways
//!   [`crate::api::capability::CapabilityFacts`] documents. `buffer_support` —
//!   keyed on the sixty-four usage masks, a space enumeration could have covered —
//!   panics, which is the correct reading: a mock that was asked to be a device
//!   and recorded nothing is a broken mock. `texture_support`, `binding_support`,
//!   and `route` carry an unbounded component in their keys and answer
//!   `Unsupported`. A test that needs any of the four wants
//!   [`MockDevice::with_capabilities`] and a table it states itself, which is the
//!   same thing that makes the contract under test visible.
//! - **It lowers buffer creation and nothing else.** A
//!   [`crate::api::resource::backend::BufferBackend`] it hands back is a token holding
//!   the size and usage it was asked for — no memory, no address, no operation —
//!   which is enough to prove the portable verb reached the backend and not
//!   enough to prove anything about a GPU. Texture, view, sampler, shader,
//!   binding, pipeline, recorder, submission, and presentation seams do not exist
//!   yet; when they do, this backend grows the same way the native ones will.
//!
//! # Why it is `cfg(test)` and not behind `test-support`
//!
//! The `test-support` feature exists in `Cargo.toml`, and the mock will move
//! behind it as soon as something outside this crate's own test build needs it —
//! a sibling crate's integration test, an example, or a conformance binary. It is
//! not there yet because the promise would be premature: moving it now would mean
//! this backend's use in a `--features test-support` (non-`test`) build
//! un-fulfilling the `#[expect(dead_code)]` attributes that guard the
//! constructors it calls, and trading a real diagnostic for a feature name.
