//! Safe bridge from the `Send + Sync` device façade to a current native GL context.
//!
//! WGL/EGL contexts are thread-affine, while the public RHI device is not.  It
//! is therefore unsound for `NativeGlDriver` to contain `glow::Context` or a
//! [`super::NativeContext`] directly: that would either fail `Send + Sync` or
//! tempt an `unsafe impl Send` which lets a public handle call GL from an
//! arbitrary thread.  Instead the platform integration supplies a
//! `NativeGlOwner`.  Its methods synchronously marshal to the thread on which
//! its WGL/EGL context is current, perform real lowering there, and return only
//! opaque GL names across the seam.
//!
//! This is a deliberately narrow internal adapter, not a public context/session
//! model.  A host without a synchronous owner-thread dispatch route cannot
//! honestly create a native GL RHI device: it must leave the driver uninstalled
//! and receive `Unsupported`, rather than report success and defer work forever.
