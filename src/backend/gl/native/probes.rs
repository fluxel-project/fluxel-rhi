//! Native operation probes: the capability-resolution executor.
//!
//! Discovery treats a version string as evidence of an available *route*, never
//! as proof that a capability works. This module runs small, fully owned GL
//! operations (compile/link a trivial program, bind a scratch buffer or image,
//! issue a zero-effect dispatch/draw, attach a scratch texture or renderbuffer
//! to a scratch framebuffer) and records the structured outcome. Every probe
//! uses scratch objects that are unbound and deleted on every return path,
//! consumes the GL error it produced, and never performs wall-clock or
//! heuristic inference: `Unavailable` (the probe could not run), `Failed` (the
//! driver answered or errored), and `Passed` are the only outcomes.
//!
//! Probe sources are minimal GLSL/ESSL programs written here from the public
//! GL/GLES specifications; nothing outside Fluxel contracts and the public
//! registry semantics is consulted.
