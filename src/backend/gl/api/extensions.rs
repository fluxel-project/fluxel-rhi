//! Typed extension evidence and fail-closed core-or-extension resolution.
//!
//! # Inventory decisions
//!
//! Every registry name the accepted profiles can report is either typed with a
//! real command path or recorded from its exact spelling with a written reason
//! for having none. An entry without a command path still keeps its provenance
//! and stays visible in `raw_reported_names`, but no `CoreOrExtension` row
//! resolves against it, so it acquires nothing and enables nothing:
//!
//! - `WEBGL_multi_draw_instanced_base_vertex_base_instance` is a working draft
//!   with no ratified entry-point set and no browser shipping it as a stable
//!   API, and its commands are a strict refinement (per-draw base vertex/base
//!   instance) of the normalized advanced-draw domain, whose browser path does
//!   not exist yet. A typed wrapper would own a call path nothing can prove, so
//!   the name is recorded raw-only until a browser advanced-draw domain exists
//!   to consume it.
//! - `WEBGL_shader_pixel_local_storage` is an isolated fragment-local semantic
//!   with no matching RHI semantic in this series; the plan forbids exposing it
//!   as compute, storage-buffer, or general storage-image capability. It is
//!   recorded raw-only rather than mapped to a domain whose semantics differ.
//! - The first multiview revision (`GL_OVR_multiview`) is not aliased onto the
//!   typed multiview name: that name carries the second revision's semantics,
//!   and aliasing revisions would claim a shader contract this contract does
//!   not implement. It remains an untyped raw name.
//!
//! # Route alternatives
//!
//! A `CoreOrExtension` row names at most one typed extension alternative, and
//! no row in this contract has a second one: on every accepted profile each
//! normalized capability is reachable through exactly one route, so the row
//! keeps a single optional slot instead of a preference list. The routes an
//! audit named as unexpressible are decided here rather than modelled:
//!
//! - `GL_ARB_timer_query` is the extension form of the timer-query row's
//!   desktop core floor, and every desktop profile this contract accepts is 4.0
//!   or newer, so core supplies that row on every accepted desktop context and
//!   an alternative spelling could never be the enabling evidence. The only
//!   profile where core does not supply it is WebGL2, whose route is the
//!   WebGL2 typed name, so the desktop extension form is not a typed name here
//!   at all.
//! - `GL_ARB_multi_draw_indirect` cannot satisfy anything: glow 0.18 binds no
//!   `glMultiDrawArraysIndirect`, so the probe is permanently `Unavailable`, and
//!   every confirmed limit set fixes the multi-draw-indirect count at `None`,
//!   which leaves that row unable to enable on any profile even if the name were
//!   acquired. A second alternative would describe a route nothing can reach.
//! - `GL_ARB_direct_state_access` is an issuance style (which entry points
//!   create and update objects) rather than a capability, so it satisfies no
//!   row and cannot be an alternative to one. A `CoreOrExtension` row records
//!   what a context can do, never which command spelling Fluxel uses to do it.
//!
//! Registry-spelling variants are not a second alternative either: the
//! anisotropic, multiview and compressed-texture spellings collapse onto one
//! typed name in `GlKnownExtension::from_raw_name`, so "the same capability
//! under several runtime names" is already recorded at the raw level while the
//! row stays single-valued.
//!
//! When a row does have two real alternatives, the minimal shape is a
//! preference-ordered set of alternatives resolved exactly as `extension` is
//! today (legality for the profile, then acquisition or a passed probe).
//! `CapabilityEvidence::Extension` already names the alternative that resolved
//! the row, so the recorded provenance needs no change to carry that. Building
//! the list before such a row exists would add a routing system with no
//! consumer.
//!
//! Provenance is not capability: recording a name here never enables a
//! capability on its own.
//!
//! # Deferred typed homes for recorded platform facts
//!
//! Two platform observations reach this contract as free-form keys on
//! `GlContextFlags.other`, and both were handed forward as wanting a typed home.
//! Neither typed home is built here, for the same reason in both cases: no
//! consumer reads the fact, so a type would be an API with no reader, and a fact
//! nothing consumes is better carried by the free-form set that already exists
//! than by a struct that has to be maintained, versioned and answered. This
//! section is the decision; each entry names the typed home and the trigger that
//! would make it real.
//!
//! - **Driver identity beyond the context's own answers.** Some contexts expose
//!   an optional debug route that answers the real vendor and renderer strings
//!   instead of the aliases the platform chose. The browser provider reads that
//!   route and records exactly one of three shapes under `webgl.unmasked-vendor=`,
//!   `webgl.unmasked-renderer=`, or `webgl.unmasked-identity=unavailable`, so a
//!   later reader can tell an answered route from one never asked. It is
//!   deliberately neither a capability nor a parsed identity: a vendor string
//!   describes a driver rather than promising anything about it. The typed home
//!   is a registry variant in this module, which is where a route's provenance,
//!   its legality per profile, and its acquisition are already decided; the
//!   literal spelling of the route stays in `browser/driver_identity.rs`, so no
//!   registry name reaches a public or crate-public identifier, a doc comment,
//!   or an error message. The trigger is a consumer that needs the identity as a
//!   *value* rather than as a recorded observation -- a hardware-evidence record
//!   that has to select or compare a driver, which would read a field instead of
//!   matching a prefix.
//!
//! - **Native surface facts.** The default framebuffer's color, depth and
//!   stencil component widths and its sample count are recorded by the native
//!   provider as `gl.surface-*` keys -- the one piece of format evidence no
//!   `GlFormatTable` row carries, because the flipped surface is not a resource
//!   this layer allocated. Its color encoding is recorded as unavailable rather
//!   than guessed, since no accepted profile answers that query and a wrong
//!   guess between linear and sRGB is a double-gamma error. Every path that
//!   cannot observe the surface records a reason instead of a value: one of
//!   `unqueried`, `query-failed`, or `draw-framebuffer-bound` after
//!   `gl.surface-facts-unavailable=`, so "not asked", "asked and refused", and
//!   "asked while a framebuffer was bound" never collapse into one answer. A
//!   failure additionally names the component that failed, after a colon, because
//!   the first real desktop context this crate opened produced a bare one and no
//!   reader without that context could say which of the eight queries it was. The
//!   typed home is a `GlSurfaceFacts` value on `GlDiscoverySnapshot`, owned by
//!   `discovery.rs`; the trigger is a consumer that acts on the facts rather
//!   than reporting them -- presentation, which needs the drawable's component
//!   widths and sample count as numbers to size what it presents, and which a
//!   typed answer spares from parsing a formatted marker and from branching on
//!   a failure shape it cannot act on.
//!
//! The shape of both changes is the same: the string keys stay until a consumer
//! arrives, and the typed home is then added beside them rather than
//! reinterpreted from them, because a key/value pair a reader already depends on
//! cannot become a struct field without breaking that reader.
