//! two halves are what the differential contract needs: the accepted half proves
//! the trace names the shape that ran, the rejected half proves the guard runs
//! before the side effect.  Two optional domains have no executable provider in
//! this contract (no family binds a multi-draw-indirect or advanced-offset entry
//! point yet), so the rules those halves enforce are the ones the descriptors and
//! capability rows define rather than the ones a provider call site would.
