//! Mock indirect command-buffer domain: single draw, batch, and counted batch.
//!
//! The record layouts, their ABI, and the capability rows live in
//! `api/indirect.rs`; this module only mirrors what a provider does with one
//! record: prove its row, prove the record sits where it claims to, prove the
//! pass, then prove the command buffer's role and that the range lies inside
//! the allocation it names.  The order is the providers'
//! order, so a trace that shows an accepted command also shows which of those
//! facts it needed, and a trace that shows only an error proves the guard ran
//! before the binding changed.
//!
//! Two of these three domains have no executable provider in this contract: the
//! native families bind no multi-draw-indirect entry point, and WebGL2 has no
//! indirect mapping at all.  The recorder implements them anyway, because the
//! differential contract covers the whole Layer 1 vocabulary rather than only
//! the subset a provider happens to reach today; where a rule would otherwise be
//! invented it is taken from the capability row that gates the domain rather
//! than from a provider call site that does not exist.
