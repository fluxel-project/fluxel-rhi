//! Transactional Vulkan submission spine.
//!
//! A Fluxel submission has a stronger contract than Vulkan's incremental queue
//! API: returning `Err` proves that no work from the plan was accepted.  Vulkan
//! callers normally record and submit command buffers incrementally, but doing
//! that would make a later lowering failure ambiguous.  We therefore record,
//! begin and end every batch before the first `vkQueueSubmit`.
//!
//! Once that first submit is made, failure is execution-domain state, never the
//! return value of `submit`: a Vulkan implementation may have accepted part of
//! the call before reporting an error, and reporting `Err` would lie to the
//! portable caller.  The spine poisons the accepted serial range and reports
//! `Failed` (or `DeviceLost`) from completion instead.
