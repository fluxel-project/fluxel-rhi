//! Why this backend could not lower a request.
//!
//! Variants preserve whether a refusal is about lowering, bounded waiting, an
//! already-observed device loss, or a native call. This distinction is what lets
//! the device layer terminate the execution domain without treating ordinary
//! unsupported work or timeout as loss.
//!
//! # Why this sits at the chapter root, beside `ffi`
//!
//! Every lowering in this backend returns it: `command`'s four step modules, the
//! descriptor writes in [`crate::backend::dx12::binding`], and the root-signature
//! and state-object builds in [`crate::backend::dx12::pipeline`]. It was written
//! inside `command` when the command spine was the only lowering there was, and it
//! moved here when the second and third chapters arrived — a vocabulary three
//! sibling chapters and the platform chapter all agree on is a contract, and
//! `CLAUDE.md` section 8 keeps contracts out of whichever module happens to use
//! them most. The move is what keeps the dependency one-directional: `command`
//! lowers dispatches *through* `binding`, so `binding` importing a type from
//! `command` would have pointed the arrow backwards.
//!
//! [`ffi`] sits beside it for the same reason and owns the other half: this type
//! says *which kind* of failure it is, and `ffi` is what decides that from a
//! `HRESULT`.
