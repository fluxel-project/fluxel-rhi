//! The narrow Direct3D 12 boundary: return-code classification and the two
//! native readings that have no portable spelling.
//!
//! This is the only module in the DX12 backend where a `HRESULT` becomes an API
//! v1 error, and for that reason it is also the only module that decides whether
//! a failure ends the device's identity. Two callers want those two answers
//! separately — the device layer must set a terminal status *and* return an
//! error, while a resource allocation must return an error and leave the device
//! running — so classification and error construction are two functions rather
//! than one.
//!
//! # Why Direct3D 12 learns about loss late
//!
//! There is no device-loss callback and no `VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST`. A removed
//! device reports `DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED` from the next call that touches
//! it, and the call that first reports it is arbitrary. That is why nothing here
//! caches or pre-checks a liveness flag: a cached "the device is fine" is a
//! second source of truth that is wrong for exactly the window in which it
//! matters.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! The `windows` crate supplies these declarations and its COM wrappers, so no
//! vtable is hand-built here and no pointer arithmetic appears in this module.
//! The `unsafe` that a Direct3D 12 backend cannot avoid — `D3D12CreateDevice`'s
//! out-parameter, mapping a resource, executing a command list — lives at the
//! call sites that own the object being passed, each with its own written
//! rationale. This module holds none of it.
//!
//! # Test reach, stated rather than assumed
//!
//! The tests below are pure logic — a return code maps to a classification, a
//! UTF-16 buffer becomes a `String` — and nothing in them needs a GPU. They still
//! only run on Windows, because they construct `windows::core::Error` and read
//! `DXGI_ERROR_*` out of the binding crate, which does not exist elsewhere. That
//! is a real gap against the cross-platform conformance suite `version-plan.md`
//! section 4 asks for, recorded here instead of left to be discovered: a Linux CI
//! row would silently run none of it. Closing it means classifying a raw `i32`
//! against locally declared codes, which trades the binding crate's authority for
//! reach, and that trade has not been made yet.
