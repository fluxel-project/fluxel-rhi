//! What a portable binding kind becomes on Direct3D 12: one register class, and
//! one view.
//!
//! This is the file where section 19.3 stops being a rule about *not* conflating
//! two vocabularies and becomes the lowering that deliberately bridges them. A
//! logical `group`/`slot` is not an HLSL `register`/`space`; the artifact's
//! [`ShaderAbiVersion`](crate::api::shader::ShaderAbiVersion) is what pins the two
//! together, and ABI 1.0 says:
//!
//! ```text
//! space           = group index
//! register number = slot id
//! register class  = BindingKind, by the table below
//! ```
//!
//! | portable kind | register class | view |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `UniformBuffer` | CBV (`b`) | `D3D12_CONSTANT_BUFFER_VIEW_DESC` |
//! | `StorageBuffer { ReadOnly }` | SRV (`t`) | raw buffer SRV |
//! | `StorageBuffer { ReadWrite }` | UAV (`u`) | raw buffer UAV |
//! | `SampledTexture` | SRV (`t`) | typed texture SRV |
//! | `StorageTexture { ReadOnly }` | SRV (`t`) | typed texture SRV |
//! | `StorageTexture { ReadWrite }` | UAV (`u`) | typed texture UAV |
//! | `Sampler` | `s` | `D3D12_SAMPLER_DESC` on the sampler heap |
//!
//! # Why a storage buffer is a *raw* view
//!
//! `D3D12_BUFFER_SRV`/`UAV` can address a buffer either as a byte range
//! (`Flags = ..._FLAG_RAW`, `Format = R32_TYPELESS`, the HLSL `ByteAddressBuffer`
//! and `RWByteAddressBuffer` pair) or as an array of fixed-size elements
//! (`StructureByteStride != 0`, the HLSL `StructuredBuffer<T>` family). The
//! structured form needs the element stride, and nothing in v13 carries one:
//! section 18.1 makes a buffer byte-addressed with no element type, and
//! [`BindingKind`](crate::api::binding::BindingKind) has no stride field. So the
//! raw form is the only one this ABI can express, and it is the only one this
//! backend builds. A `RWStructuredBuffer` in a shader is therefore *not* ABI 1.0
//! — the shape it needs cannot be described — and the mismatch is a driver
//! validation error rather than a silent misread, which is the direction this
//! crate prefers.
//!
//! # Why one kind maps to one class and not to a choice
//!
//! `BindingKind::StorageBuffer` carries `access`, and the class follows from it
//! rather than from anything the caller passes at bind time. A read-only storage
//! buffer *is* an SRV: presenting it as a UAV would let the shader write through
//! a binding section 22.2 made read-only, which is exactly the class of mistake
//! the access field exists to prevent.
