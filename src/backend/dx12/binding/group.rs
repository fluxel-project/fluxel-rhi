//! The native descriptor packet behind one portable bind group.
//!
//! A group is a *range* of the device's one shader-visible heap, filled with view
//! descriptors. Creating one therefore has exactly three jobs: claim a run long
//! enough for the layout, write each entry's view into the slot its layout named,
//! and keep alive everything an address in that run points at.
//!
//! # Why the group owns the resources
//!
//! A native descriptor holds a *pointer* — a GPU virtual address, or a heap
//! address — and Direct3D 12 has no notion of a descriptor referring to a
//! resource. Section 22.2 makes the bind group the owner of everything it binds,
//! and on this backend that is literal: drop the last portable [`Buffer`] handle
//! while a group still points into it and the driver reads freed memory, which
//! surfaces as corruption and not as an error. So [`Dx12BindGroup`] holds a
//! [`Buffer`] for every entry it wrote an address for, and the descriptors stay
//! meaningful exactly as long as the group does.
//!
//! That is also why the *range* is released in `Drop` rather than by the device:
//! the slots and the reasons for holding them have the same lifetime.
//!
//! # The byte-address rule, and the constant-buffer one
//!
//! A raw buffer view addresses DWORDs, so a storage range becomes
//! `FirstElement = offset / 4` and `NumElements = len / 4`, and an offset that is
//! not a multiple of four cannot be expressed at all. A constant-buffer view's
//! `SizeInBytes` must be a multiple of 256, so a shorter range is *widened* to the
//! next multiple. Both are narrowings the portable layer does not state — section
//! 18.1 lets a caller bind any range the device's alignment limits permit — and
//! neither is rounded silently: a range that cannot be expressed is refused
//! rather than moved, because moving it would change which bytes the shader reads.
//!
//! Widening a constant buffer is the one asymmetry.  `Dx12Buffer` privately
//! pads a uniform-capable native allocation, so the widened tail is backed
//! without changing the portable buffer's logical size.  Raw views receive no
//! equivalent widening: their DWORD tail must be exact, because that descriptor
//! would otherwise expose logical bytes outside the caller's `BufferRange`.
