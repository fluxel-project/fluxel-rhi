//! The shader-visible descriptor heap, and the free-range allocator that hands
//! slots out of it.
//!
//! One heap per device, created with the device and living as long as it. It is
//! shader-visible because a descriptor table is set by *GPU* address, and only a
//! shader-visible heap has one; a non-visible heap would be reachable from the
//! CPU only and could never be named in `Set*RootDescriptorTable`.
//!
//! # Why one heap and not one per bind group
//!
//! Direct3D 12 allows at most one CBV/SRV/UAV heap to be bound at a time on the
//! command list (`SetDescriptorHeaps` takes an array, but the API documents that
//! only one of each type may be set, and the driver refuses more). A bind group
//! created on its own heap would therefore be un-bindable beside any other group,
//! which is the opposite of what a bind group is for. So the heap is a device
//! resource and a group is a *range* of it.
//!
//! # Why the allocator coalesces
//!
//! A frame that creates and drops bind groups every frame would otherwise shred
//! the free list into runs of one, and a request for four contiguous descriptors
//! would fail against a heap with four hundred free descriptors in it. Merging
//! adjacent free runs on release is what keeps the answer to "is there room" a
//! fact about the heap's occupancy rather than about the order things were
//! dropped in.
//!
//! # What this module does not own
//!
//! Which descriptors an allocation needs, and what gets written into them. That
//! is [`super::layout`]'s plan and [`super::group`]'s writes. This module knows
//! only about runs of integers.
//!
//! TODO(perf): This persistent shader-visible descriptor allocator is correct
//! because a bind-group-owned range is not returned until the group drops, so a
//! submitted list cannot see its slots rewritten. A frame/ring allocator or
//! descriptor cache must instead defer reuse to the last `CompletionPoint` of
//! every list that can reference a range. Rust `Drop` alone is not sufficient
//! once a range can be recycled independently. Heap slots and retirement stay
//! backend-private; the portable binding and completion APIs already suffice.
