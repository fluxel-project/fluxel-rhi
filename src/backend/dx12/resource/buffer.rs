//! Buffer allocation on Direct3D 12.
//!
//! This is the first lowering in this backend, and its job is the smallest one a
//! lowering has: turn an already-validated [`BufferDescriptor`] into one
//! `ID3D12Resource`. Nothing here decides whether the descriptor is acceptable —
//! size, usage, and the device's own ceiling have all been checked in
//! `Device::create_buffer` before this is reached — so a failure returned from
//! here is one only Direct3D 12 can know, and
//! [`crate::api::RhiErrorKind::InvalidUsage`] is not among the errors this file
//! can produce.
//!
//! # The heap, and why the preference does not select it
//!
//! [`ResourceMemoryPreference`] is a performance hint and never a correctness
//! guarantee (section 11.2), and both of its variants lower onto
//! `D3D12_HEAP_TYPE_DEFAULT`. The reason is not that the distinction was skipped:
//! section 11.2 deleted host-visible buffers from the portable surface, so the
//! only two mutation paths are upload and readback, and both of those are the
//! *transfer* chapter's staging resources — which this backend allocates for
//! itself and which a caller never names. There is therefore no caller-stated
//! preference that could select `UPLOAD` or `READBACK`, and a backend that picked
//! one anyway would be placing a GPU-only resource in host-visible memory where
//! every later `CopyBufferRegion` touching it is slower.
//!
//! # Initial state, and the one flag that is not a hint
//!
//! The initial state is `D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_COMMON`. Direct3D 12 promotes a
//! resource out of `COMMON` implicitly on first use, so recording a narrower
//! state here would claim knowledge of what the resource will be used for, which
//! is the command chapter's to know and not this one's.
//!
//! `D3D12_RESOURCE_FLAG_ALLOW_UNORDERED_ACCESS` is different in kind: it is not a
//! preference but a *creation-time* grant, and a buffer created without it cannot
//! be a UAV at all — no later barrier or descriptor makes it one. Section 11.1
//! makes `BufferUsage` a creation-time correctness contract for exactly this
//! reason, so `STORAGE` is what turns it on. The flag is granted only when the
//! bit is set, because granting it unconditionally would make every buffer a UAV
//! candidate and quietly relax the contract the caller stated.
