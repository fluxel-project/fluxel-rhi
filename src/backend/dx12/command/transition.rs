//! The transition barriers one step of a recording needs, released together.
//!
//! # Why this is a type and not four lines at each call site
//!
//! `D3D12_RESOURCE_BARRIER`'s `pResource` is a `ManuallyDrop`, so a barrier built
//! the obvious way takes one reference to the resource and dropping the barrier
//! does **not** release it. `ResourceBarrier` copies the struct into the command
//! stream rather than taking ownership of it, so a caller that lets the barrier
//! fall out of scope leaks exactly one reference per barrier — a leak that grows
//! with every frame and never shows up as an error.
//!
//! Reclaiming it is a `ManuallyDrop::drop` on a union member, which is `unsafe`
//! and easy to get wrong in the direction of a double release. Putting it in a
//! `Drop` impl means it is written once, with one rationale, and cannot be
//! forgotten at a call site. Note that `D3D12_RESOURCE_BARRIER`'s own `Clone` is
//! a `transmute_copy` that does *not* add a reference, so a clone of a barrier is
//! a second owner of one reference — this type never clones one.
//!
//! # What this module does not own
//!
//! Which transition a step needs, and in which order relative to the command it
//! brackets. That is the invariant
//! [`crate::backend::dx12::command`] documents — every list restores ordinary
//! resources to `COMMON` and presentation resources to `PRESENT` — and it belongs
//! to the lowering that knows what the step is, not to the barrier holder.
