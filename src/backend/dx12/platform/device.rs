//! The Direct3D 12 logical device: one `ID3D12Device`, its liveness, and the
//! lowering verbs the portable layer reaches it through.
//!
//! This is the DX12 half of [`crate::api::platform::backend::DeviceBackend`]. What it
//! owns is the native device and the answers that belong to *that* device — its
//! adapter snapshot, its object id, whether it is still alive, and its capability
//! table. What it does not own is anything a sibling chapter already owns:
//! adapter choice is [`super::provider`]'s, the classification of a native
//! failure is [`crate::backend::dx12::ffi`]'s, allocation is
//! [`crate::backend::dx12::resource`]'s, recording and submission is
//! [`crate::backend::dx12::command`]'s, and each of those is called from here
//! rather than reimplemented.
//!
//! # Device loss, as Direct3D 12 reports it
//!
//! D3D12 has no device-loss callback: `DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED` arrives as the
//! return code of the next call that touches the device. There is therefore
//! nothing for [`DeviceBackend::poll`] to poll *for liveness* — the return code of
//! a real call is the only signal there is — and this chapter never caches a
//! liveness flag derived from anything else.
//!
//! What a device does carry is a one-way cell recording that loss once it has
//! been observed, because section 6.5 makes loss terminal for the whole identity
//! and [`DeviceBackend::status`] is how a caller reads it. Every native boundary
//! shares that authority: allocation, pipeline creation, submission, fence
//! progress, readback mapping, and presentation all publish the same stable first
//! reason and terminate pending asynchronous state.
//!
//! # Why the capability probe runs here, once, at creation
//!
//! [`super::facts::probe`] is called from [`super::provider`]'s `create_native`,
//! next to `CreateCommandQueue` and `CreateFence` and for the same reason: these
//! are the native questions a device either answers or does not, and a device
//! that cannot be asked is better refused at creation than discovered halfway
//! through a frame. A table filled lazily would put the first capability answer
//! on whichever call happened to arrive first.
