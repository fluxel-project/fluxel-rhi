//! What a live Direct3D 12 device reports about itself, read through
//! `CheckFeatureSupport`.
//!
//! This module owns one step and no others: turning a created `ID3D12Device`
//! into a [`CapabilityFacts`]. It decides nothing about legality, holds no
//! resource, and is not consulted again after device creation — section 7.2
//! makes an enabled contract immutable, so the table built here is the table the
//! device reports for its whole life.
//!
//! # Why this runs against a device
//!
//! Direct3D 12 answers every capability question through a device. `DXGI` can
//! hand out an adapter name and a vendor id without one, but format support,
//! resource-binding tiers and multisample quality levels all come from
//! `ID3D12Device::CheckFeatureSupport`, and there is no adapter-level spelling of
//! them. The provider creates a temporary D3D12 device during adapter enumeration
//! and uses this probe to publish a complete `AdapterInfo` snapshot; device
//! creation runs the same probe for the final native device before validating its
//! requirements.
//!
//! # What is probed, what is structural, and what is still absent
//!
//! Being explicit about which is which, because "the table is full" and "the table
//! is complete" are different claims and only one of them is true here.
//!
//! - **Probed.** Per-format storage access and attachment support come from
//!   `D3D12_FEATURE_FORMAT_SUPPORT`. A refusal from `CheckFeatureSupport` on it
//!   is reported as a backend failure rather than swallowed: it is a mandatory
//!   question, so a device that cannot answer it is not a device this backend can
//!   describe.
//! - **Structural.** All three [`OptionalFeature`]s are recorded without a probe,
//!   and the reason is written at each call site. Two of them — `Compute` and
//!   `BindingArrays` — are properties of Direct3D 12 itself: every D3D12 command
//!   list has `Dispatch`, every D3D12 root signature has descriptor ranges. The
//!   third, `SamplerAnisotropy`, is structural in a subtler way that is worth
//!   knowing before writing a probe that cannot exist: Direct3D 12 has **no
//!   queryable maximum sampler anisotropy**. `MaxAnisotropy` is a field of
//!   `D3D12_SAMPLER_DESC` that the caller fills, and the specification requires
//!   every device to accept the whole range 1 through 16, so there is no
//!   `CheckFeatureSupport` question whose answer could be "this device cannot
//!   filter anisotropically" — a device like that would not be a D3D12 device.
//!   Recording these as structural facts rather than as unasked questions is what
//!   keeps a caller from being told a D3D12 device cannot dispatch or cannot
//!   filter.
//! - **Structural, with two probed rows.** [`record_binding_support`] fills the
//!   binding table, and most of it is a claim about Direct3D 12 rather than a
//!   reading: a buffer's role is decided by the root signature and the resource
//!   state, not by the resource. The storage-texture rows are the exception — they
//!   read the same two format-support bits the texture table reads — and the two
//!   limitations the table *does* record come from the header's own dimension
//!   enums, which have no multisampled 1D, 3D or cube spelling and no cube UAV
//!   member at all. See that function for why each negative is a fact instead of a
//!   hole.
//! - **Absent, and deliberately not guessed.** View-compatibility facts are not
//!   recorded yet, and seven of the twenty-seven
//!   [`crate::api::platform::LimitKey`]s are not either. The seven are the ones
//!   that name a ceiling Direct3D 12 does not state, and
//!   [`record_api_shape_limits`] lists them rather than filling them with a
//!   number borrowed from another API's convention.
//!   [`CapabilityFacts::binding_limit`] is absent for a related reason that is
//!   worth stating where the table is missing rather than where it is read: the
//!   answer it wants is a *per stage and class* ceiling, Direct3D 12 defines none,
//!   and the two constants in the neighbourhood — the descriptor-heap tiers and the
//!   sampler-heap size — are pool sizes shared by every stage and every pipeline.
//!   Recording one of those as `binding_limit(Vertex, SampledTextures)` would put a
//!   per-stage rule in the device's mouth. `None` is the spec's "inapplicable"
//!   answer and the portable layer's "no ceiling to impose", which is what this
//!   device is; what that costs is stated at [`probe`].
//!   Texture facts, route facts, binding facts and the other twenty limits *are*
//!   recorded. What is left is a real coverage gap and it is recorded as one rather
//!   than papered over: see [`probe`] for what a caller observes while it stands,
//!   and [`record_limits`] for why the missing limits are a *mapping* problem
//!   rather than a probing one.
//!
//! # The route table, and the one operation it refuses
//!
//! [`record_format_routes`] and [`record_buffer_route`] fill
//! [`crate::api::resource::route::RouteQuery`]'s table. The key is not one a
//! backend can walk in full — the two texture-to-texture routes carry a `u32`
//! sample count on each side — so this table is under the same obligation as the
//! texture one: record every *legal* key, because an unrecorded legal route is a
//! refusal to execute an operation the device can perform, and section 9.4 makes
//! that refusal final rather than advisory.
//!
//! The refusals in this table are therefore of two kinds, and they are worth
//! telling apart. A key naming a plane its format does not have, or a
//! texture-to-texture pair whose formats differ, is *not a route this device
//! lacks* — it is not an operation Direct3D 12 offers at all, and it is left to
//! the negative because there is nothing to record. A **filtered blit** is the
//! other kind and the more important one: Direct3D 12 has `CopyBufferRegion`,
//! `CopyTextureRegion`, `CopyResource`, `CopyTiles` and `ResolveSubresource`, and
//! no filtered or scaled blit at any of them. Recording `Unsupported` for every
//! blit key would be recording nothing, so the walk records none — and the refusal
//! is structural, which is what makes it safe to reach by absence. A test asserts
//! it on a real device so that a later change cannot quietly start promising a
//! lowering section 9.4 forbids.
//!
//! # Which texture keys can be asked and which cannot
//!
//! [`CapabilityFacts::texture_support`] is keyed on a combination a backend
//! cannot walk in full, so an absent key there answers the negative rather than
//! panicking — the same rule the buffer table inverts, for the reason the
//! capability module gives. The obligation that replaces "fill everything" is
//! weaker but real: a *legal* combination left unrecorded would tell a caller
//! that a texture the device can create cannot be created, and that failure is
//! silent because a negative is a well-formed answer. [`record_texture_support`]
//! therefore walks every dimension, sample count, usage mask and cube intent for
//! every format this backend can name, and both halves of that claim have a test:
//! the walk's coverage is asserted on a real device, and the rules that turn a
//! support word into an answer are asserted without one.
//!
//! # The one table that must be complete
//!
//! [`CapabilityFacts::buffer_support`] is keyed on [`BufferUsage`], whose space
//! is sixty-four masks a backend can walk in full, so
//! [`crate::api::capability::CapabilityFacts`]'s lookup rule makes an absent
//! entry there a hole in enumeration rather than an answer — it panics. That
//! makes this table the one place where a partial enumeration is not a smaller
//! answer but a crash, which is why it is filled here in full and first.
//!
//! Every non-empty combination is recorded as supported, and that is a claim
//! about Direct3D 12 rather than about a driver: a D3D12 buffer resource is
//! created with no usage flags at all, and what a buffer may be used for is
//! decided by the root signature that binds it and the resource states it is
//! transitioned through. Vertex, index, constant, and unordered-access uses are
//! orthogonal states, so any combination of them is expressible — it costs
//! transitions, not legality. The empty mask is recorded as unsupported, because
//! a buffer with no usage bit has no legal operation at all and section 12.3
//! refuses to create one.

/// # What a caller observes while the gaps above stand

/// correctness and is recorded here rather than left to be discovered.
///
/// The **binding table is no longer one of them**, and that difference is the one
/// worth knowing about. A binding answer of `Unsupported` is not conservative the
/// way those two are: it is a refusal of a legal layout, so an unrecorded legal
/// binding would silently forbid something the device can do. That is why
/// [`record_binding_support`] walks every combination and records an explicit

/// per-stage ceiling is imposed, because Direct3D 12 does not state one — and
/// whose consequence belongs to the layer that does allocate descriptors: a
/// pipeline interface whose aggregate a real heap cannot hold is refused when the

///
/// The route table is no longer one of those gaps, and the difference is worth

/// cross product is five figures before any format is named — which puts this
/// table under the same obligation as the texture-support walk next to it: not
/// "fill everything" but "do not leave a legal combination unrecorded". An
/// unrecorded legal route is a refusal to execute an operation the device can
/// perform, and section 9.4 makes that refusal final rather than advisory.
///
/// The walk below is over the combinations this backend can lower for every
/// public input accepted by the route vocabulary. Buffer↔texture carries its
/// D3D12 image-placement and 3D-slice constraints in `TexelCopyLayoutLimits`,
/// so those rejections occur at recording rather than Phase A. The two rules
/// that decide texture-copy membership are:
///
/// - **A copy covers one plane, and only a plane the format has.** Section 15.3
///   makes the aspect set a property of the format, so a color format has no
///   depth route and a depth-only format has no color one. The formats in section
///   8.1's P0 set that carry a stencil plane are the depth-stencil ones.
/// - **A texture-to-texture copy does not convert.** `CopyTextureRegion` moves
///   texels between resources of the same format, dimensionality and sample
///   count; a differently-typed pair is not a copy that needs a capability, it is
///   a copy the API does not offer. The sample counts are therefore walked once
///   and used for both sides rather than crossed with each other.
