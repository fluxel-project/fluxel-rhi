# ADR-0005: Require GPU conformance evidence for native correctness claims

**Status:** Accepted

## Context

Compilation, mocks, and CPU protocol tests cannot prove that DX12 and Vulkan
commands, barriers, shaders, and readback agree with portable semantics.

## Decision

Claim native correctness only when the same compiled ExecutionPlan runs on
DX12 and Vulkan with Required validation and an independent CPU oracle.
Artifacts identify the exact commit, backend, hardware/driver, inputs,
expected/actual result, completion, outgoing state, and diagnostics.

Release conformance is run from a clean Windows `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
checkout. The runner rejects a conflicting `CARGO_BUILD_TARGET`, records the
checked-out 40-character SHA, and writes the command, toolchain, target,
environment, GPU identity, timestamps, exit status, and observed case results
alongside the run log. These local artifacts are release evidence, not
source-controlled claims of success. After the matching annotated tag is
pushed, the artifacts are attached to that tag's GitHub Release; their durable
asset URLs close the evidence chain without changing the tested commit.

## Alternatives

- Treat CI compilation, TestRhi, or one backend demo as conformance.
- Let readback assume a convenient state instead of consuming an export's
  reported outgoing state.

## Consequences

Hardware fixtures are distinct from ordinary tests and are rerun on the final
commit before release through the release conformance runner. CPU and compile evidence remain
useful but are labeled as such; they do not substitute for native oracle
evidence. A release is not tagged when either backend's required fixture is
unavailable or fails.

## Evidence

0.1.2 C01–C03, 0.1.3 K01–K02, and 0.1.4 R01/R02/X01 established the pattern.
0.2.0–0.2.7 extended it through U01–U08 and exact-SHA release reruns.

See the [RHI design](../design-rhi.md) for the current test-evidence boundary.
