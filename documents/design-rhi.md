# Fluxel RHI design

This is the short architecture guide for `fluxel-rhi`. The public Rust API,
its rustdoc, and its positive/negative/boundary tests are the executable API
reference. This document records the stable model, points to the decisions
that explain it, and names work that is deliberately not enabled yet.

## Scope

RHI owns portable GPU execution: device-scoped resources, shader and pipeline
creation, recording actual uses, plans, submission, completion, presentation,
readback, retirement, capability reporting, diagnostics, and observability.

It does not own a RenderGraph, renderer scheduling, material policy, native
handles, native synchronization objects, capture artifacts, or a replay
runtime. Backends keep their native objects and strategy private.

## Public model

```text
PlatformProvider -> Adapter -> Device
Device -> resource / shader / binding / pipeline / command
CommandRecorder -> RecordedWork -> SubmissionPlan -> CompletionPoint
ConfiguredPresentation -> AcquiredFrame -> FrameAttachment -> present outcome
```

The public modules are `platform`, `capability`, `format`, `resource`,
`shader`, `binding`, `pipeline`, `command`, `submission`, `presentation`,
`statistics`, `diagnostics`, and crate-private tooling support.

Native host composition enters through the public crate-level provider factories
(`create_dx12_provider`, `create_vulkan_provider`, `create_metal_provider`, or
the browser `create_webgpu_provider` where their target features exist). These
functions return only `PlatformProvider`; native instances, surfaces, and
window handles stay in the host/backend seam.

## Invariants

- Every object belongs to one opaque `DeviceIdentity`; loss terminates that
  identity and a replacement device receives a new one.
- Capability facts are the authority. Backends must finalize and validate one
  immutable capability snapshot before exposing a device; every public query on
  that snapshot is total. A supported fact requires validation, native
  lowering, lifetime/loss handling, and conformance evidence.
- `command::ResourceUse` is derived from recorded commands. It includes
  scheduling-only query-slot writes and resolve reads without pretending a
  `QuerySet` is a buffer. RenderGraph owns declarations and scheduling, while
  directly reusing this portable vocabulary; RHI itself does not own graph
  policy or types.
- Only operations which may wait for a future event are async. Logical object
  creation, validation, capability queries, and recording are synchronous.
- `submit(Err)` accepts no native work. `submit(Ok)` transfers plan ownership;
  acceptance, GPU completion, and present outcome remain distinct states.
- `FrameAttachment` is not a `Texture` or `TextureView`. It is valid only for
  the acquired-frame lifecycle that produced it.
- Transient lifetimes use `PlanPoint` ordering. `Dedicated` allocation is the
  correct baseline; aliasing is a private, capability-gated optimization.

The total-query rule above is the required contract, not a claim that the
current constructor already checks every finite query domain. The current
implementation can still route a missing required finite-domain entry to the
query-time panic used to identify an incomplete enumeration. Capability
snapshot finalization is an entry gate for the next implementation plan: it
must move that failure into device construction so a successfully published
device never exposes it.

## Decision records

| ADR | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| [0012](adr/0012-pure-rhi-execution-boundary.md) | Keep RHI limited to portable execution. |
| [0013](adr/0013-async-operation-boundary.md) | Make only future-event operations asynchronous. |
| [0014](adr/0014-terminal-device-loss.md) | Treat device loss as a terminal identity state. |
| [0015](adr/0015-plan-scoped-transient-allocation.md) | Freeze plan-scoped transient lifetimes and dedicated fallback. |
| [0016](adr/0016-capability-claims-require-lowering-closure.md) | Publish facts only after lowering closure. |
| [0017](adr/0017-presentation-is-not-a-texture-view.md) | Keep presentation frames separate from textures and completion. |
| [0018](adr/0018-capture-observability-without-capture-ownership.md) | Preserve observability without owning capture/replay. |
| [0019](adr/0019-portable-logical-statistics.md) | Keep statistics logical rather than native profiling. |
| [0020](adr/0020-optional-feature-family-admission.md) | Admit optional feature families as complete portable contracts. |
| [0021](adr/0021-shader-owned-immediate-abi.md) | Derive executable immediate-data ABI from shader artifacts, not interface supersets. |
| [0022](adr/0022-hardware-conformance-evidence.md) | Separate portable contract tests, headless hardware conformance, and presentation smoke evidence. |
| [0023](adr/0023-host-rhi-integration-boundary.md) | Keep host-window lifetime and RHI presentation integration in separate dependency domains. |

Existing ADRs cover unsafe/native containment, serial lowering policy,
conformance evidence, platform test gates, and the GL-family private boundary.

## Current TODO boundary

The public vocabulary already carries provisional/experimental advanced
mesh/task shaders, ray tracing, cooperative matrices, aliasing, external
interop, multiplanar formats, native debug capture, HDR/timing, and advanced
descriptor indexing. These names do not freeze a descriptor ABI or promise
availability. A backend keeps each incomplete fact disabled and returns
structured `Unsupported` before native work. It must not replace an incomplete
path with a panic, dummy success, or silent fallback.

Current examples include transient physical aliasing, counted indirect paths,
Metal timestamp/statistics, WebGPU timestamp placement/conversion, and
WebGPU host-image interop. See ADR-0020 and the capability facts for the exact
per-backend answer.

Native discovery backends expose public provider composition functions. GL and
WebGL are context-adopting backends, so their remaining integration work is a
small host-composition crate or bridge which returns `PlatformProvider` without
putting an HGLRC/EGLContext/WebGL context, browser session, or token in the
RHI API. This is an ecosystem integration TODO, not an excuse to weaken the
portable boundary.

## Change rule

For a new stable boundary: write or update one focused ADR, update public API
and rustdoc, add positive/negative/boundary tests, then implement and test
every backend that publishes the capability. Performance-only changes stay
backend-private provided observable execution, loss, completion, and tooling
semantics remain unchanged.
