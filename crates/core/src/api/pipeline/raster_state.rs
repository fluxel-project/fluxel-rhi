//! Section 25: raster fixed-function state.
//!
//! Primitive, blend, depth/stencil and multisample state as data: what a caller
//! states, with constructors that make the common legal state cheap to write. The
//! chapter keeps depth bounds, programmable sample positions, and VRS absent
//! rather than reserving placeholders. Polygon mode, depth clip control, and
//! conservative rasterization are present and capability-gated at pipeline
//! creation.
//!
//! Not owned here: every rule that compares this state against a device, a target
//! signature or a shader. Those live with the pipeline, in `raster.rs`, because
//! they are conditions of pipeline creation rather than properties of the state.
