//! Present planning identity and present outcome (specification section 45).
//!
//! What a plan's presentation is called, and what became of it: the plan-local
//! present identity the builder hands back, the failure and state vocabulary a
//! present terminates in, and the receipt `Device::submit` returns alongside the
//! completion token. It does not own the frame (`frame.rs`), the plan it belongs
//! to (section 39), or the closure rules that decide which work may touch a frame
//! (section 45.3, which is the builder's).
//!
//! Invariant: a present outcome and a GPU completion are **independent**. Section
//! 45.5 fixes the four ways they can disagree — GPU complete with the present
//! outdated or target-lost, both lost — and forbids the one inference that would
//! collapse them:
//!
//! ```text
//! a present failure is NOT "the work was not submitted"
//! Accepted is NOT "the screen has displayed it"
//! ```
//!
//! `Accepted` here means the presentation system or host lifecycle took ownership
//! of the frame. Metal's `present(_:)` schedules drawable presentation during
//! command-buffer scheduling rather than reporting scan-out, which is exactly why
//! the portable vocabulary stops at ownership.
