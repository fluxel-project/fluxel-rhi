//! Contract tests for the platform chapter (specification sections 5 through 7).
//!
//! Only the rules that are decidable without a backend are testable here, and
//! they are the ones that matter most: section 3.1 requires every public
//! operation to validate identity *before* touching a backend, so a wrong-device
//! or wrong-provider argument has to be refused by the façade rather than handed
//! down for a driver to discover. Everything else in this chapter panics with a
//! documented message and is covered by shape tests instead.
//!
//! The verbs that *are* backed run against [`crate::api::tests::mock`], which is the
//! conformance vehicle described in that module: it answers from memory, so the
//! portable rules it exercises are checked on every platform in the same run.
//! It proves nothing about hardware, and nothing here should be read as if it
//! did.
