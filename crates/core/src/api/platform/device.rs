//! The device: a shared logical execution domain (specification section 6).
//!
//! Everything a caller creates, records, submits, or presents is owned by a
//! device, and every one of those objects must be traceable to the same
//! [`DeviceIdentity`]. This module owns the device's own surface — who it is,
//! what it came from, what it can do, and whether it is still alive.
//!
//! The verbs that *create* things are not here. `Device::create_buffer` is
//! written in the resource module, `Device::create_pipeline` in the pipeline
//! module, and so on, each next to the types it produces. Rust allows the
//! inherent impl to live in another module of the same crate, and doing so keeps
//! one rule in one place instead of collecting every creation verb into a file
//! that would have to know about every resource in the crate.
//!
//! This module deliberately does not own the capability vocabulary
//! ([`crate::api::capability`]) or presentation
//! ([`crate::api::presentation`]); it only hands out handles to them.
//!
//! # What is decided here and what is asked elsewhere
//!
//! The device holds an [`DeviceIdentity`] and a backend, and nothing else. Every
//! verb that needs a native fact — provenance, identity, liveness, progress —
//! asks the backend through the crate-private lowering seam, which section 59 of
//! `08-governance-freeze-checklist.md` keeps off the public surface and which
//! this documentation therefore cannot link to. What stays here is the part a
//! backend must not decide: the identity comparison section 3.1 puts first, the
//! order in which ownership and liveness are judged, and the structured error a
//! caller sees.
//!
//! Liveness in particular has one home and it is not this one. The backend
//! observes the loss and holds the fact; this module holds the rules about it —
//! that it is terminal, that the summary is stable (section 6.5), and that a lost
//! device answers `DeviceLost` only once ownership has been settled. Caching the
//! fact here as well would create a second authority for it, which is the thing
//! section 65.3 rules out.
