//! Sections 19.5-19.7: what one entry point requires.
//!
//! The resource requirements in the binding vocabulary, the location interface,
//! and the optional features and device limits the entry point needs. This is the
//! caller's statement; it is deliberately not a
//! verdict about any device.
//!
//! Not owned here: the vocabulary the requirements are written in (19.1-19.4, in
//! `vocabulary.rs`) and the rules that check the statement (19.6-19.7, in
//! `validation.rs`). Section 19.5 reuses `BindingKind` and `BindingCount`
//! directly rather than defining shader-side copies, so the two cannot drift.
