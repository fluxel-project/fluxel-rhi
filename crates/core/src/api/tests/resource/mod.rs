//! Resource, route, upload, and readback contract tests (specification
//! sections 9 through 18).
//!
//! The tests are partitioned by specification section, one file per
//! section group, because a single file had grown past the size at which
//! a reader can hold it. The conventions below apply to every submodule,
//! so they are stated once, here:
//!
//! Every validation rule a specification list states is exercised twice —
//! once with a descriptor that must be accepted, once with one that must be
//! refused — and each refusal asserts the exact
//! [`RhiErrorKind`](crate::api::error::RhiErrorKind), because
//! the kind is the part a caller may branch on.
//!
//! Two conventions run through these tests:
//!
//! * Most rules here are decidable without a backend, so most capability answers
//!   are *built* rather than probed and the validators take them as parameters.
//!   The exception is the creation verb itself: whether a refusal happens *before*
//!   a backend is touched is a claim about call order, so those tests run over
//!   `api::tests::mock`, which counts allocations instead of performing them.
//! * Objects that only a test needs are assembled through `tests::fixture`, and
//!   objects that a device verb produces are made by asking the mock device for
//!   them — the same way `tests/identity.rs` reaches the token constructors. A
//!   test that could not name an object could not test what an accessor reports
//!   about it.
