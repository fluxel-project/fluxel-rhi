//! Live-inventory and memory-estimate tests (specification 47.14–47.18).
//!
//! This is the one part of section 47 whose arithmetic is fully specified and
//! fully testable without a device, so it is tested exhaustively rather than
//! reviewed as a shape. Section 47.17 gives a closed formula over a descriptor
//! and a format's facts, and the facts are a parameter rather than a device
//! query — which is exactly the seam that lets a test drive every branch,
//! including the two that produce [`MemoryEstimate::unknown`].
//!
//! The test names record the expected byte counts as literals rather than as
//! recomputed expressions. That is deliberate: a test that re-derived the number
//! the implementation derives would pass for any implementation, and the point of
//! these is to be an independent statement of what the specification says the
//! number is.
