//! Contract tests for the submission chapter (specification sections 39 to 41),
//! including the submission-lane vocabulary of section 10.
//!
//! These are the review instrument for the plan interface, not a conformance
//! suite: no hardware is behind them and none of them may be presented as GPU
//! evidence. What they *can* answer is the half of the chapter that is portable
//! and therefore real today — which refusals happen before a device is reached,
//! what kind each one carries, and whether the rules of sections 40.4 and 45.3
//! are decidable at all from the facts a caller holds.
//!
//! # What makes that possible without a backend
//!
//! Every fact the builder needs is either a caller's own value or an
//! enumeration-time device answer, so the tests drive the builder through the same
//! crate-private constructor the port will use
//! ([`SubmissionPlanBuilder::with_facts`]) and hand it a lane table built by hand.
//! Nothing here reaches a driver, and nothing here is a substitute for the
//! hardware evidence the chapter still owes.
//!
//! # What these tests cannot reach
//!
//! ```text
//! a plan's native lowering and acceptance           no backend in this crate does it
//! the cross-plan hazard check of section 41.4       needs accepted-work history
//! ```
//!
//! The first row is why the acceptance tests below run against
//! [`crate::api::tests::mock`]'s device: that backend accepts a plan and executes none of
//! it, which makes the *portable* half of section 41 — the phase split, the two
//! completion levels, the polling rule — reachable today. It is evidence about
//! this crate's logic and not about any GPU; `version-plan.md` section 4 still
//! requires a real DX12 and Vulkan run over raster, compute, copy, upload and
//! readback before this chapter is closed.
