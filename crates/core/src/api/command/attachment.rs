//! Raster attachment sets and their invariants (specification sections 31.1
//! through 31.4).
//!
//! This module owns the attachment *set* of one raster scope: which views are
//! attached at which color location, whether they are loaded or cleared and
//! stored or discarded, and the resolve pairing of a multisampled color target.
//!
//! # What this module does not own
//!
//! - Command ordering or the state machine. Attachments are validated here and
//!   recorded by [`crate::api::command::raster`]; nothing here knows whether a
//!   scope is currently open.
//! - Whether a *format* may be a color or depth attachment at all. That is
//!   [`crate::api::format::FormatFacts::color_attachment`], which is a probed
//!   device fact and cannot be read without a device. What is checked here is the
//!   portable half: the texture's own `COLOR_ATTACHMENT` /
//!   `DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT` usage bit, the clear value's numeric class, and
//!   the resolve pairing's own consistency.
//! - Whether a *frame* may be the target of a direct multisampled resolve.
//!   Section 46.1 permits that route "only when the active presentation facts and
//!   the resolved route facts prove that target, format, sample count, and resolve
//!   route", and those are device facts. This module answers the portable half —
//!   [`ColorAttachmentView::allows_resolve_into`] — and refuses a frame, so the
//!   permission belongs to the device façade; without that split the one route the
//!   gate exists for would be allowed unconditionally.
//! - The pipeline's view of the same set. A pipeline carries a
//!   [`RenderTargetSignature`] and the scope carries the attachments; comparing
//!   them is [`crate::api::command::raster`]'s `set_pipeline`.
//!
//! # The invariant this module enforces
//!
//! **All active attachments of one scope are one attachment set**: one device,
//! one extent, one sample count, one layer. Section 31.4's rule is what makes a
//! raster scope lowerable as a single native render pass, and it is checked once
//! at `begin_raster` rather than per draw, because the set cannot change inside a
//! scope.
