//! Live inventory and the logical memory estimate (specification 47.14–47.18).
//!
//! Two questions that share a module because they are asked together: "what
//! exists right now" and "roughly how many bytes is it". Neither is a history —
//! the inventory is a present-tense fact, unaffected by a collection epoch, and
//! the estimate is computed from a descriptor rather than measured from a heap.
//!
//! # The estimate is logical, and the name is load-bearing
//!
//! Section 47.15 freezes the field name as `logical_estimated_bytes` and section
//! 47.17 lists what it excludes:
//!
//! ```text
//! tiling / swizzle         heap fragmentation
//! row alignment            alias reuse
//! driver metadata          residency
//! compression / mip tail
//! ```
//!
//! and names three things it must never be called: `vram_bytes`,
//! `gpu_memory_bytes`, `physical_bytes`. A caller that wants to know how much
//! memory a frame actually costs on a device is asking an allocator question,
//! and section 47.1 leaves that to allocator telemetry rather than answering it
//! here with a number that would be wrong by an unknown factor and would differ
//! per driver.
//!
//! # Where a number comes from, and where it does not
//!
//! `estimate_texture_bytes` implements section 47.17's arithmetic in full, and
//! is driven directly by the contract tests because the rule needs only a
//! descriptor and a format's facts. It answers [`MemoryEstimate::unknown`] in
//! exactly two cases, both of them stated by the specification rather than
//! chosen here: any intermediate overflow, and a format whose
//! `logical_bytes_per_block()` is `None` because the format name fixes a
//! semantic rather than a layout.
