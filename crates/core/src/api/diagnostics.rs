//! Diagnostic events and label canonicalization (specification section 48).
//!
//! **This file is being written in specification order.** It owns the diagnostic
//! severity vocabulary, the diagnostic event a caller can observe, and the pull
//! verb that drains the device's queue of them.
//!
//! It deliberately does not own logging, sinks, formatting, level filtering, or
//! threading policy. The RHI emits structured events and a host decides what to
//! do with them; a library that formats its own log lines fixes a host's output
//! policy from inside the library, and a library that takes a callback fixes the
//! host's threading policy. Section 48's own comment on `drain_diagnostics` —
//! *"Pull model; avoids imposing a callback threading policy"* — is the whole
//! reason the verb takes an output vector instead of an observer.
//!
//! # Canonicalization (section 48.1)
//!
//! Section 48.1 states a rule that reaches across the whole specification: every
//! descriptor that participates in a compatibility id, a fingerprint, a capture
//! definition, or a statistics identity comparison must be canonicalized first,
//! and it splits descriptors into two classes that must not be treated alike.
//!
//! ```text
//! set-like          stable sort, and reject semantic duplicates or deduplicate
//!                   (as each type defines it)
//!                   TextureDescriptor.view_formats, DeviceRequirements
//!                   required/preferred feature sets, ShaderInterface
//!                   resources/inputs/outputs, BindGroupLayout entries,
//!                   BindGroup entries
//!
//! ordered-semantic  retain semantic order; must NOT be sorted
//!                   PipelineInterface.groups, color target locations,
//!                   Submission batches/work, commands
//! ```
//!
//! The *rule* is stated once, here. The *implementation* is not here, and
//! deliberately so: what counts as a semantic duplicate is decided by the type
//! that owns the vector — two `TextureFormat` entries for the same format are
//! duplicates, while two `PipelineInterface` groups with the same contents are
//! not interchangeable at all — so a canonicalizer that lived in this module
//! would have to know every descriptor in the crate. Each owning module exposes
//! a `pub(crate) fn canonicalize_*` next to the type it canonicalizes, and the
//! hashing code calls it before hashing.
//!
//! The last line of section 48.1 is the boundary that keeps labels from becoming
//! load-bearing: `Label` and diagnostic strings do **not** participate in
//! compatibility or fingerprint correctness. [`DiagnosticEvent::label`] is
//! therefore text for a human, and nothing in this module may be read as a
//! canonicalization of the object's identity.
