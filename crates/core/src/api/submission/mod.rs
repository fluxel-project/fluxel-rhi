//! Submission, completion, and presentation (specification sections 39 through 45).
//!
//! This module owns the plan and its acceptance: what a caller builds before it
//! submits, what the RHI guarantees when it accepts, what completion means once
//! work is running, and when the RHI may reclaim a resource. The presentation
//! chapter is the sibling that runs before and after it —
//! [`crate::api::presentation`] owns the target, the lease, and the frame, this
//! module owns the plan the frame enters and the receipt that reports what became
//! of it.
//!
//! ```text
//! submission/plan.rs        plan identity, the validated plan body              (39, 40)
//! submission/builder.rs     the plan builder, hazard and closure validation     (40)
//! submission/completion.rs  completion state, receipt, submit acceptance         (41)
//! ```
//!
//! # What this module does not own
//!
//! - **Recorded work.** A batch carries `Vec<RecordedWork>`, which the recording
//!   chapter owns and this module only validates against a lane. The plan
//!   builder never records a command and never inspects a command's internals;
//!   it reads the two things a recording publishes for exactly this purpose —
//!   its device identity and its execution domains — plus the merged actual-use
//!   summary that sections 40.4 and 45.3 need.
//! - **Native submission machinery.** Section 39 opens by listing what is
//!   deliberately absent from this surface: no queue, fence, semaphore, event, or
//!   timeline value is public, and a logical completion point is not a native
//!   fence value (section 41.7). `SubmissionLaneId` plus explicit dependency
//!   edges are the complete portable input for a backend that later maps lanes to
//!   multiple native queues; a backend that has one queue may serialize them.
//!   Native queue selection, fence waits, descriptor reuse, resource retirement,
//!   and state tracking remain backend-private implementation choices.
//! - **Retirement bookkeeping.** Section 41.6 defines retirement as a *property*
//!   rather than a verb: native backing may be reclaimed once the last batch that
//!   actually referenced an object is terminal and no CPU logical owner remains.
//!   There is deliberately no `retire()` a caller could call, and this module adds
//!   none. This is also the seam for backend-private descriptor retirement: a
//!   descriptor is not reusable merely because its logical handle was dropped.
//! - **Presentation.** Section 45.1 puts `present_after` on this module's builder,
//!   but the frame it consumes, the lease it leases, and the present outcome types
//!   are [`crate::api::presentation`]'s.
//!
//! # Invariants this module enforces
//!
//! ```text
//! a batch's work is non-empty and belongs to the plan's device      (40.1)
//! a lane accepts every execution domain its work contains           (40.1)
//! different lanes have no implicit order                            (40.2)
//! an unordered overlapping write is MissingDependency               (40.4, 41.4)
//! accepted != complete, and no Err is returned after acceptance     (41.3)
//! a dropped plan or builder submits nothing and abandons its frames (41.9, 45.6)
//! ```
//!
//! # The submission-lane vocabulary lives here
//!
//! `SubmissionLaneId`, `SubmissionLaneClass`, `LaneWorkDomains`,
//! `SubmissionLaneInfo`, `SubmissionCapabilities`, and `LaneDependencyRoute` are
//! stated by module 02's section 10, but they are submission concepts: a lane is
//! what a batch is added to, and a dependency route is what `add_dependency`
//! consumes. They are therefore defined in this file, and their *use* in resource
//! queries stays in [`crate::api::resource`]. That split is adjudication A18 in
//! the 0.16 plan: the definition site is the owner, and a file follows the meaning
//! of a type rather than the chapter number that happens to state it.
