//! Specification section 54: the captured object definitions.
//!
//! One responsibility: **what an object is, stated without a handle to it.**
//! Every type here is the tooling-side projection of a live RHI object's
//! descriptor, and together they are the object reconstruction graph of section
//! 52.3 — a TextureView names its Texture, a BindGroup names its layout and its
//! resources, a PipelineInterface names its layouts, a RasterPipeline names its
//! modules, its interface, and its fixed state.
//!
//! Not owned here: the events that carry these definitions ([`super::event`]) and
//! the mutation and command values that are *not* object definitions
//! ([`super::mutation`]). Nor is the capture-local typed ID: section 54 states
//! that the Capture Artifact Layer maps a runtime [`ObjectId`] to its own
//! capture-local ID, and that RHI tooling defines no disk typed-ID encoding. So
//! the identity in every type below is the runtime one, and the mapping is
//! deliberately absent rather than stubbed.
//!
//! # The invariant this file exists to keep
//!
//! Section 54 restricts a tooling definition to value types, [`ObjectId`], and
//! [`AcquiredFrameId`](crate::api::presentation::AcquiredFrameId). A live RHI
//! handle must not be included. That is not
//! tidiness: a definition holding a `Buffer` would keep the buffer alive and
//! make the record outlive the device by accident, and it would let a captured
//! record be read back as a *usable* resource, which is Replay's job and not a
//! reader's. Every field below is therefore one of:
//!
//! ```text
//! ObjectId              a name, not a handle
//! AcquiredFrameId       a name, not a handle
//! a descriptor          a value type, and one from the section that owns it
//! a Label               a value type
//! ```
//!
//! # Why the descriptors are the live ones
//!
//! [`CapturedObjectDefinition::Buffer`] carries a
//! [`crate::api::resource::buffer::BufferDescriptor`] and not a tooling-local
//! copy of it. Two shapes for "what a buffer is" would be two things to keep in
//! step, and the live descriptor is already a value type with public fields, so
//! the copy would buy nothing and cost the drift. Sections 55 and 56 are written
//! the same way, except where a live type is *directional* and the captured one
//! must not be — which is a note for the file that hits it.
