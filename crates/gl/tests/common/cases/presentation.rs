//! Portable presentation lifecycle conformance workload.
//!
//! A presentation target is deliberately host-owned: an `HWND`,
//! `ANativeWindow`, `CAMetalLayer`, or browser canvas must not escape into the
//! RHI API merely so this test can run.  Therefore a backend fixture supplies
//! the already registered [`PresentationTarget`], a configuration selected from
//! that target's *current* facts, and a raster-capable logical lane.  Everything
//! after that boundary is one portable contract: configure, acquire, clear the
//! frame attachment, submit/present, observe the independent GPU and present
//! outcomes, reconfigure, and prove an abandoned frame releases the lease.
//!
//! The fixture must not replace this with a backend-local frame loop.  In
//! particular, a successful native `Present` is insufficient evidence: this
//! workload waits for both `CompletionPoint` and `PresentReceiptId`, because
//! those outcomes intentionally have independent terminal states in v13.
