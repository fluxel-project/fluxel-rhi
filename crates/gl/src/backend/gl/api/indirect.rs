//! Indirect command-buffer record layouts and their validated ranges.
//!
//! The records are the WebGPU-aligned indirect argument layouts this contract
//! accepts, so a caller that uploads WebGPU-shaped arguments needs no repacking.
//! The single, multi, and count paths stay distinct types because they have
//! distinct record shapes, distinct buffer roles, and distinct capability
//! evidence; they are never interchangeable. This module owns the layouts and
//! the range arithmetic only: issuing a command, binding its buffer, and
//! checking the context's capability belong to the provider.
//!
//! A range is legal only when both of its bounds hold, and both live here. The
//! record validators prove a record fits inside the range; the allocation bound
//! proves the range fits inside the buffer the range names. Checking only the
//! first lets a caller describe a window wider than its allocation, which makes
//! the driver read an argument list that was never allocated -- a silent
//! out-of-bounds read rather than a rejection. The two checks are therefore
//! separate functions that every indirect entry point applies at the same point
//! in the same order, so the native provider, the browser provider, and the
//! recorder cannot diverge on either the rule or its error.
