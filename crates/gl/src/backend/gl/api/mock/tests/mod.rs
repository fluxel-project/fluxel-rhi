//! evidence is split by subject -- the oracle's own answers in `oracle`, the
//! optional command domains in `command`, the multiview gate in `multiview` --
//! because the fixtures are the one part every group must agree on while the
//! groups themselves change for unrelated reasons.
//!
//! The discovery fixtures are shared with the api-level suite rather than
//! copied. This suite used to keep its own copy, for the sound reason that a

//! be invalidated by an edit in flight. That reason has expired: no package is
//! moving that file now, and two copies of a limits table can drift apart
//! without any test noticing, which is the failure the shared fixture exists to
//! prevent. `api/tests/mod.rs` exposes them `pub(crate)` for exactly this.
