//! Surface presentation over the drawable the Host owns.
//!
//! This module owns exactly one thing: the executor's half of the presentation
//! domain. The drawable and the flip belong to the platform layer (the WGL and
//! EGL surface providers, which own the window and call the swap), so the
//! executor records the extent the Host reports, hands out one lease per frame,
//! and flushes the frame's commands so that the platform flip that follows shows
//! a complete frame. It never creates, sizes, or swaps a drawable.
//!
//! Publishing is the one place the executor writes into the drawable rather
//! than beside it, and it still does not own the drawable: the default
//! framebuffer is the borrowed context's, the blit that fills it is the step
//! between "the frame is finished" and "the platform flips", and the flip
//! remains the platform's call after this returns.
