//! Native OpenGL / OpenGL ES context ownership and entry-point evidence.
//!
//! This is deliberately below the platform-neutral [`crate::backend::gl::api`]
//! contract.  WGL and EGL objects never escape this module: a caller hands us a
//! context which it has already made current, and receives a `!Send` executor
//! tied to that thread.  In particular, this is not shared with the WebGL
//! implementation; browser objects have a different lifetime model.
//!
//! The native minimum is desktop GL 4.0 or GLES 3.0.  A newer context is kept
//! at its actual version.  Optional functionality is admitted from *both* the
//! version/extension ledger and the loaded entry-point table, never from a
//! version string alone.
