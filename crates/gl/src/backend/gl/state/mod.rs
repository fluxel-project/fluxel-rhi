//! Conservative GL-family driver-state mirror.
//!
//! The GL, GLES and WebGL adapters all run on a mutable context.  This module
//! owns no GL objects: it remembers only values successfully installed through
//! its context-private authority. `Unknown` is intentionally the initial state; assuming
//! GL defaults would make a raw host-context call silently invalidate a skip.
//!
//! The module is backend-private.  It is shared by desktop GL, GLES and WebGL2
//! lowering, while profile/extension admission remains in the capability probe.
