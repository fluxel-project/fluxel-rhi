//! The Direct3D 12 command spine: recording a batch, committing it, and
//! observing it finish.
//!
//! This module owns the four native objects Direct3D 12 requires before any work
//! can run — a command queue, command allocators, command lists, and a fence —
//! and the order a plan's batches are put through them. It decides nothing about
//! legality: every plan reaching it has passed section 40.5's checklist in the
//! portable layer, so a refusal produced here is one only Direct3D 12 can know.
//!
//! What a single step *is* — the transitions a copy needs, the staging an upload
//! or a readback allocates — lives in the sibling modules this chapter declares:
//! [`super::copy`], [`super::transfer`], [`super::transition`], and the shared
//! [`crate::backend::dx12::failure::Dx12Failure`]. This file is the machinery
//! those steps are recorded onto.
//!
//! # Record everything, then commit
//!
//! Section 41.3's Phase A is "an `Err` proves no native work was accepted", and
//! the way this module makes that literally true is by recording *every* batch of
//! the plan into its own command list before a single `ExecuteCommandLists` is
//! called. A payload this spine cannot lower is therefore refused with nothing
//! committed, rather than after an earlier batch is already on the queue — which
//! is the one outcome section 41.3 forbids.
//!
//! Committing per batch, rather than concatenating the whole plan into one list,
//! is what gives section 41.2's finer completion: each batch signals its own
//! fence value, so a readback ticket and an allocator's reuse both hang off their
//! own batch rather than off the slowest unrelated one. The cost is one
//! `ExecuteCommandLists` and one `Signal` per batch instead of one of each per
//! plan, which is the price of being able to answer "is *this* batch done".
//!
//! # The state invariant, and why there is no persistent tracker
//!
//! **Every command list this spine records restores ordinary resources to
//! `D3D12_RESOURCE_STATE_COMMON` and swapchain resources to `PRESENT`.** Buffers
//! and ordinary textures are created in `COMMON`
//! ([`crate::backend::dx12::resource`]); each command transitions what it uses out
//! and back before it is done. `PRESENT` is numerically the same state value as
//! `COMMON`, but remains a distinct ownership invariant in the lowering.
//!
//! The alternative — a persistent per-resource tracker that remembers where each
//! resource was left — buys one thing: half the barriers. It costs a map that
//! must survive across submissions, must be rolled back exactly when a recording
//! is refused, and must be keyed by something stable across a resource's
//! lifetime. `CLAUDE.md` section 1 puts implementation simplicity below semantic
//! correctness but above execution efficiency, and the tracker's failure mode is
//! a hazard the driver reports as corruption rather than as an error. The
//! barriers are the price of an invariant that can be checked by reading one
//! sentence.
//!
//! Staging allocations are outside the invariant because Direct3D 12 forbids it:
//! an `UPLOAD` heap resource must be created in `GENERIC_READ` and a `READBACK`
//! heap resource in `COPY_DEST`, and neither heap permits a transition at all.
//! They are never named in a barrier, which is why the invariant stays true.
//!
//! # What this spine does not own
//!
//! - Whether a route exists. Section 9.4's answer comes from the portable
//!   layer's capability snapshot, and this module is only reached for a plan that
//!   already passed it.
//! - Whether a copy is legal. Section 34's checks ran at record time.
//! - Batch order and happens-before edges. [`crate::api::submission::backend`] documents why
//!   one native queue supplies all of them for free: the queue executes its lists
//!   in the order they were handed to it, and a batch is handed over before the
//!   next one is recorded.
//!
//! # Why a payload with no lowering is refused rather than skipped
//!
//! The recorder can grow payload variants before this backend has their native
//! lowering (resolve is the current example). Skipping one would leave the caller
//! holding a receipt for work that never happened — the silent-substitution rule
//! forbids that regardless of whether the gap belongs to the API or this backend.
//!
//! # Performance upgrade map (backend-private)
//!
//! TODO(perf): This is deliberately the correctness-first spine. Its one
//! `Mutex<SpineState>` makes recording, fence serial issuance, submission and
//! retirement one linear transaction, and its `COMMON -> use -> COMMON` policy
//! makes each submitted list self-contained. A future batch-local state-diff
//! encoder may retain final states only while this plan records, then emit only
//! necessary transitions. It must still restore `COMMON` before an independent
//! plan uses the resource, or atomically publish authoritative post-submit state
//! with rollback for every pre-commit failure. `ResourceUse`, `PlanPoint`, and
//! `SubmissionPlan` already carry the portable information; no public API grows.
//!
//! TODO(perf): Submission can narrow this lock to slot/serial reservation and
//! the short Execute+Signal commit, recording into plan-owned slots outside it.
//! The invariant must survive: before the first Execute failure accepts no work;
//! afterwards every accepted batch owns exactly one ordered completion serial and
//! all retirement is keyed to that serial.
//!
//! The device-owned fence waiter registers under lock, arms only after
//! registration, and re-samples the lowest serial after every one-shot native
//! event.  It wakes every registered future on device loss.  `CompletionPoint`
//! remains the full public seam; a future optimization may replace the worker's
//! per-event handle allocation, not its bounded-thread ownership model.
//!
//! TODO(perf): Multi-queue lowering may map existing `SubmissionLane` and plan
//! dependencies to queue-local fences and waits when workloads prove overlap.
//! It must retain per-resource ordering/state ownership and must not advertise
//! concurrent lanes until those dependencies lower; no new RHI vocabulary is
//! required.
