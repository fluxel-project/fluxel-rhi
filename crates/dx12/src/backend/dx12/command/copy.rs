//! Lowering a buffer-to-buffer copy.
//!
//! The chapter's simplest lowering, and the one that establishes the shape the
//! others follow: bracket the command with the transitions that put each resource
//! in the state Direct3D 12 requires, then return both to `COMMON` so the
//! module-level invariant holds for whatever records next.
//!
//! A free function rather than a method on
//! [`Dx12CommandSpine`](crate::backend::dx12::command::Dx12CommandSpine),
//! because a copy needs nothing from the spine: not the queue, not the fence, not
//! the device. Saying so in the signature is what keeps a reader from having to
//! check whether this step quietly touches submission state.
