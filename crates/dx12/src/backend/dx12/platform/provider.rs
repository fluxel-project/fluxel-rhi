//! The Direct3D 12 provider: adapter selection and logical device creation.
//!
//! This is the DX12 half of [`crate::api::platform::backend::ProviderBackend`]. It owns
//! the DXGI factory and the one native step that turns an adapter into an
//! `ID3D12Device`, and it decides nothing about legality — every descriptor here
//! has already passed the portable layer.
//!
//! The device this module creates is [`super::device::Dx12Device`], and the
//! request that carries it back to the portable layer is
//! [`super::request::Dx12Request`]. Both are separate files for the reason
//! The crate-private API contracts split by domain: a provider is asked about the *domain*,
//! a device carries one native object, and a request is the single-shot
//! handover between them.
//!
//! # Adapter capability snapshots
//!
//! DXGI provides identity and memory facts, while Direct3D 12 exposes the
//! capability contract through an `ID3D12Device`. Enumeration therefore creates a
//! short-lived device for every offered DXGI candidate and probes it before
//! publishing [`AdapterInfo`]. A candidate that cannot create a D3D12 device is
//! not an adapter this provider can offer; it is omitted rather than published
//! with a hollow snapshot.
//!
//! # Reachability, and the shape the expectation takes
//!
//! This file opens with the one `#![cfg_attr(not(test), expect(dead_code, ..))]`
//! that carries the whole chapter's unreachability; [`super`] explains why it
//! opens here rather than at the chapter root, and what that expectation does to
//! the lint in the files beside this one. The short version: the provider is the
//! only entry point into the chapter, nothing outside the chapter names it, and
//! an expectation placed at the chapter root would make every file beneath it a
//! live root instead of recording that none of them is.
